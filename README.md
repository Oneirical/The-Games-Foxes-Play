A nontraditional traditional roguelike about critters and soul harvesting. 

Crumble under dozens of stowaway mind parasites, sell them for profit to a narcissistic hivemind, use laser beams to defeat hordes of cybernetically enhanced housecats, die, reincarnate at the edge of spacetime itself, then do it all over again!

This game is in active development and is nowhere near a complete state. I post weekly on [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) about my progress.

Design goals:

* **Failure is as valuable as success** - This game is nigh impossible to beat without dying. Each failed challenge allows you to collect some Shattered Souls, used to power special Contingencies and respawn against terrifying opponents.

* **An unusual alternative to experience points** - Slaying creatures awards you with Souls. Souls can be invoked for minor powers, fuelled by Legends to unleash even greater effects, and used one after the other to discover devastating synergies!

* **Extensive lore presented through nonmodal elements** - If you care about why exactly the sentient air elementals have cybernetic augments, you can learn all my worldbuilding through tile descriptions and dialogue in a message box, but you will never be locked out of key-mashing and combat. Those who don't care about the "why" and just want to smash some robotic critters can easily do so without interruption.
