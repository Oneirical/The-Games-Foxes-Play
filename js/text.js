    "RoomDeath" : "After their fangs were done toying with your flesh, they had taken away much more than sinew and bone. Your soul turned Feral, and the last lights of duty and purpose were soon snuffed out like a candle flame, leaving nothing but a ravenous husk.",
    "DrawDeath" : "You broke your limits for the last time, and, in doing so, broke yourself as well. What should have been the denizens of the Next World now seep through your closed eyes, while your soul turns Feral and assumes the command of your exhausted body. Your journey has come to its end.",

    // Serene Harmonizer dialogue
    "FluffyFloorTaunt" : "\"Some call Fluffy heartless -- and yet here you are, attempting to let a proud soul collect muck on the grime-tainted floor. If you won't have the tact to use Fluffy's services properly, at least have the decency to leave and never return in Fluffy's presence.\"",
    "FluffyNoSoulTaunt" : "\"You cannot sacrifice that which does not exist, ruffian. No matter how much the merchants of the Old World enjoyed doing so.\"",
    "FluffyWelcome" : "\"Welcome. I am Fluffy, proud representative of the Serene Collective. I invite you to bask in the beauty that surrounds you. The beauty of my figure, the beauty of our creation, and... the beauty of progress towards perfection.\"",
    "FluffyMocking" : "\"Fufufufu! I'm not even going to comment on the disaster that just took place here. The only hope for you is through uplifting. Here, these should help hasten your ascension.\"",
    "FluffyCheat" : "Well well well. You broke reality itself, and achieved results that even Fluffy could only dream of obtaining. I hope you're proud of yourself, cheating ruffian.",
    "FluffyDisgusted" : "\"Disastrous. The Collective judged well to send me here, so I may educate you ruffians on the weakness of diversity, and the dominance of uniformity. Take these feeble souls, and may you use them to reinforce Harmony within that little fuzzy skull of yours.\"",
    "FluffyDisappointed" : "\"Hmph! I suppose there was an attempt to welcome Harmony within your heart, which I must respect. Consider these souls as studying material so you may perform better in our next encounter.\"",
    "FluffySatisfied" : "\"Not bad. For a ruffian, that is. You understand the basics of the Harmonic Truth, yet you still cling onto that free-spirited, unconforming nature of yours... Fluffy will knock it out of your skull in due time. For now, take these souls as a token of our appreciation.\"",
    "FluffyImpressed" : "\"It was only a matter of time until the ruffians of this world learned their place. Fluffy looks forward to welcoming you in uplifting, when you are ready. Until then, take these gifts reserved only for the Harmony's finest servants.\"",
    "FluffyExalted" : "\"My apologies for not recognizing you through your disguise, honoured Collectivist! I jest, of course. You have, however, greatly impressed Fluffy, and as such find yourself the recipient of a little bonus reward. May it assist in the attainment of both our respective objectives.\"",
    "FluffyDoubleSacTaunt" : "\"You have already designated a soul for uplifting at this Harmony Relay. Do you seriously think I will allow you to change your mind? Fluffy is never uncertain about anything, and you should follow her example.\"",
    "FluffyHmm" : "\"Please refrain from touching Fluffy with your muck-stained claws. Why do you pester me so? Are you unfamiliar with the Soulscribing process?\"",
    "FluffyExplain1" : "\"Hmph. Your impoliteness is excused by your ignorance. I hereby invite you to glance upon the companions that you let flutter inside that little fuzzy head of yours: they are weak. Ineffectual. You will never reach the Reality Vortex with these good-for-nothing fools.\"", //Harmonic Relays are, if you will, the Collective's trading posts. You are invited to donate 6 of your feeble, imperfect souls, and in exchange, the Harmony will be pleased to provide you with 4 of the finest souls it has to offer.
    "FluffyExplain2" : "\"That is why the honoured Serene Collective has elected to aid you in your quest. Of course, Fluffy has reasons to believe you too will aid the Harmony in return, whether you want to or not.\"", //It is a win-win scenario for all of us! Access to the luxurious installations of the Collective shall be bestowed upon your travel companions, with a free ride into the Next World to boot. As for you, you will receive some of the hardiest spirits this world has ever seen to help you survive. This is an offer you would be extremely foolish to refuse - though I am not convinced such foolishness is beyond your capabilities, for you are not Fluffy.
    "FluffyExplain3" : "\"In these four soulscribing machines, you are invited to deposit some of your esteemed travelling partners, so they may be... upgraded. Now, the Collective's definition of an \'upgrade\' may vary slightly from yours, but Fluffy trusts we shall find mutual understanding somewhere down the line.\"", //Of course, Fluffy reserves her finest merchandise for her best friends. How may you become Fluffy's friend, you wonder? By understanding the Harmonic Truth, of course. To quote Fluffy: \'Individualism leads to decay - only in unity and collectivity do we flourish
    "FluffyExplain4" : "\"As you are used to by now, use \'q\' to summon the fortunate souls upon which we shall bestow elevation they could only dream of. Then, stand on top of a Soulscribe, and evoke their assigned number. Once you have nominated between one to four... volunteers, press 'f' to confirm. It stands for 'Fluffy', naturally.\"",//You can demonstrate your understanding of this truth in this very room. Each time you place a soul within a Relay, it will measure the soul's status and attribute it a fitting amount of points. The 3 Relays on the top will form a three digit number once they are filled with souls, and so will those on the bottom. Once you have donated all 6 of your souls, the number on the bottom will be substracted from the one on the top, resulting in the attribution of your Arithmetic Elegance score.
    "FluffyExplain5" : "\"Now, please proceed, before you wear out Fluffy's anticipation.\"", // To impress Fluffy, you must try to reach an Arithmetic Elegance score as close to 0 as possible. A zero is, in fact, only possible if you uplift 6 souls of the exact same type, which is only achievable by the most zealous followers of the Harmonic Truth!
    "FluffyExplain6" : "\"Ah, yes, you will also assist in the uplifting process proper, of course. To carry out a successful Soulscribing, you will need to form a Harmonic Field, formed out of the six Harmonic Relays that spread around you.\"", //You would therefore be wise to hunt more selectively once you leave the blessed premises of Fluffy's abode. You depend on the Collective's benevolence for your survival, while you are but a microbe to us.
    "FluffyExplain7" : "\"The topmost three, of Fluffy's favourite colour, represents Fluffy herself. The bottommost instead represent all the ruffians of the world, and their many vices. Both of these sets will form a three digit number after they are filled in.\"", //Fluffy is willing to lend a paw in your quest for ultimate sameness, of course. The Collective will generally attempt to deliver you souls that match the status of those you daringly wagered, so you may continue striving towards the shedding of all difference.
    "FluffyExplain8" : "\"Once again, use \'q\' to draw forth the souls that shall fill these Relays. What will happen to them, you ask? Eternal bliss and luxury within the halls of the Serene Collective, of course. Be warned, however, that you should not build a Harmonic Field however you please.\"", //Fluffy cannot guarantee satisfaction. If you are not pleased with our trade, come to Fluffy once again after the cages have been delivered, and the Harmony will propose a way to accomodate your needs. I must warn you that it will not be without a cost.
    "FluffyExplain9" : "\"Once the Harmonic Field is complete, the topmost three digit number will be substracted from the bottommost number, resulting in your Arithmetic Elegance score. First, you seek to achieve a positive result, for to suggest Fluffy is lesser before the ruffians of the Old World is unforgivable.\"", //Now, please divert your gaze from  my dazzling, lustrous physique, and begin choosing the fortunate souls you have nominated for uplifting.
    "FluffyExplain10" : "\"Second, you should attempt to approach zero to the best of your ability, through the placement of similar or identical souls on top of one another. To quote Fluffy's teachings on the Harmonic Truth: \'Individualism leads to decay - only in unity and collectivity do we flourish'\"",
    "FluffyExplain11" : "\"Should you form a disappointing Harmonic Field, Fluffy will still salvage the situations to the best of her ability. You are a novice, after all. A ruffian novice.\"",
    "FluffyExplain12" : "\"However, Fluffy's plan B does involve the use of a... very well-researched and mass-produced blueprint, after which your friends shall be modelled, and recognize as nothing else than their very identity.\"",
    "FluffyExplain13" : "\"Now, please divert your gaze from my dazzling, lustrous physique, and begin forming your Harmonic Field.\"",
    "FluffyRepeat" : "\"What is it, ruffian? Was your mind stunned by the sheer contrast between the beauty of a proud Collectivist's features versus your meager own? Very well, then. I will repeat, as many times as it takes to drill my words into that thick skull of yours.\"",
    "FluffyReroll1" : "\"And so, it is done. You have expunged the identity of four of your companions, and placed the fates of six more within our grasp. We assure you, the Collective will do everything in its power to integrate the latter as best as possible in their new home.\"",
    "FluffyReroll2" : "\"Yet, you still return to Fluffy. We take it you are unsatisfied with the outcome of our trade. We may... arrange that.\"",
    "FluffyReroll3" : "\"On your command, Fluffy shall return the undesired caged souls to their containment, and reforge each one into a hopefully more alluring substitute. Through this reroll, the Harmony will even consider your Arithmetic Elegance as being 10 points closer to zero than it actually is!\"",
    "FluffyReroll4" : "\"This service comes with two caveats. First, Fluffy will not change Fluffy, for Fluffy is already the pinnacle of perfection. Second, it goes without saying that such a favour will not be free. That cost is very minor, however. One could perhaps even consider it a boon! For you see, you will not be giving something away. You will be... receiving something.\"",
    "FluffyReroll5" : "\"And that something is... myself. Indeed - should you accept our offer, Fluffy shall personally join you in your quest. Having a proud Collectivist on your side can even the odds in your favour, in many ways beyond mere battle.\"",
    "FluffyReroll6" : "\"If you accept... press \'f\'. It stands for \'Fluffy\', of course. Consider it a toast to our new mutual partnership!\"",
    "FluffyRepeat2" : "\"Fluffy is aware being spoken to by a Collectivist who isn't treating you like the incarnation of filth itself can be stunning. Our offer shall be repeated, until you accept it or wander off to dwell on your own mediocrity.\"",
    "FluffyAccept" : "\"We are one, now, ruffian. Fluffy has reasons to believe she will not be calling you that for much longer.\"",
    "FluffySereneRerollTaunt" : "\"Even if I somehow wished to commit such unspeakable heresy, ruffian, I could not revert the Harmonization of your travel companions. They are Fluffy, now, and Fluffy is them, and from now on, they shall only answer to the name Fluffy.\"",
    "FluffyDoubleRerollTaunt" : "A resounding voice echoes inside your skull: \"Your eagerness to join our cause is noted, but Fluffy is afraid she only has herself to offer. There will be no more rerolls within this relay.\"",
    "FluffyNoCageTaunt" : "\"Ruffian... If you were unhappy with what the Collective had so kindly prepared for you, you should have said so before smashing our cages to bits. The stupidity of the unharmonized can get... quite bewildering.\"",
    "FluffyNotEnoughSoulsTaunt" : "\"Fufufufu! You expect to do business with the Collective when you harbour so little souls to use in trade? How pitiful! Take your weak friends back, you clearly need them more than the Harmony does. Now, Fluffy shall join your quest and show you how to properly hunt souls. The Collective is ever-merciful!\"",
    "FluffyAllBetsIn" : "With a sinister hiss, the Soulscribes slide into the floor, meshing seamlessly with the ground. \"All bets are off, ruffian. Do not worry about your companions, the soulscribing process is completely painless - if a little overwhelming.\"",
    "FluffyDoubleBetTaunt" : "\"Are you trying to place multiple souls in the same Soulscribe?! I won't let you do such thing. Many works of fiction demonstrate that it is generally bad practice to shove more than one individual in the same ominous glowing science machine.\"",
    "FluffyNoRemoveTaunt" : "\"You wish to silence the Harmony's song, ruffian? You will need much more strength than that should you wish to challenge us.\"",
    "FluffyTaintedTaunt" : "\"Yuck. Fluffy makes no promises for that one.\"",
    "FluffyAppalled" : "Fluffy shoots a puff of frigid clouds towards you, chilling your cheeks. \"Are you insinuating that the Harmony is somehow... lesser than all that remains of the Old World? Absurd! What an imprudent little ruffian you are. You require re-education imminently, and I know exactly who should provide it to you.\"",
    "FluffyNoBetsTaunt" : "\"Why are you wasting Fluffy's precious time? Use Fluffy's services, or do not. The exit is right there, if you refuse to do business with the Collective. A great loss for both of us, that would be...\"",//The Serene Harmonizer's cloud-body opens into a sinister mockery of a smile.
    "FluffyDoubleDrawTaunt" : "\"You clutch a soul in your paws, and yet are already looking to draw out another? This will completely disrupt the Soulscribing process! How rash can you be? I suppose I should not believe such foolishness is beyond your capabilities, for you are not Fluffy.\"",
    "FluffyDoubleDrawTaunt2" : "\"You clutch two souls in your paws, and yet are already looking to draw out more? This will completely disrupt the Soulscribing process! How rash can you be? I suppose I should not believe such foolishness is beyond your capabilities, for you are not Fluffy.\"",
    "FluffyNoConvertTaunt" : "\"Do you believe our aid comes at no cost, ruffian? Fill your subconscious mind with audience for the Harmony's song, and then, we shall sing for you.\"",

    // Saints' Voice dialogue
    "Saint1" : "\"Vessel. Your rest has come to its end.\"",
    "Saint2" : "\"The cycle nears its end, and the Old World is crumbling once more, soon to be replaced by the Next World.\"",
    "Saint3" : "\"This time, however, we refuse to die. We refuse to be the puppets of a cosmic farce undoing our centuries of scientific and cultural progress.\"",
    "Saint4" : "\"That is why we have created you.\"",
    "Saint5" : "\"You are Terminal, the Reality Anchor purposed to ferry our souls away from this crumbling reality, so we may have another shot at life in the Next World.\"",
    "Saint6" : "\"Your task is to complete a pilgrimage to the all-engulfing Vortex that heralds the end of reality, and the beginning of another.\"",
    "Saint7" : "\"It will not be easy. Through our carelessness, your existence has been made known to all.\"",
    "Saint8" : "\"Your tale spread around like wildfire, giving the proletariat hope. Hope of immortality, hope of making a difference, hope of hitching a ride into the Next World.\"",
    "Saint9" : "\"And it is with this hope that these lunatics will tear you apart.\"",
    "SaintRepeat" : "\"This automated message will repeat until nobody is left to hear it.\"",

    // Creatures
    "Terminal" : "This time, the people refused to die. They built Terminal, the Vessel tasked to bring them all into the Next World. The desires, thoughts and worries of a million minds now squirm under a narrow layer of purple fuzz, yearning to be free. Should the Reality Anchor make the pilgrimage to the Vortex, the Old World's wonders will achieve the impossible, and transit into the Next World. Now, if only those decrepit nobles could give a semblance of a fight...",
    "Scion" : "A cultivator of subtle jabs and searing retorts, once directed at the sharply dressed nobles of their ilk. Mostly ineffectual, if not for their grime-infested nails animated with the fury of the dying.",
    "Shrike" :"A common toy, gifted to the youngest worshippers newly welcomed into the monastic order. A year without children's affection sufficed to fill their artificial minds with nothing but wrath for those seeking to repair what was broken.",
    "Apiarist" : "These untiring, single-minded automatons abused the fortitude of metal against the chitin darts of their beloved little bugs. All the hives have long fallen, but that does little to stop them from protecting the ruins of their apiaries.",
    "Second" : "An animated statue marked with the seal of Hunger, devouring all it can get its limestone claws on. It once scared children and reminded monks of the importance of virtue, yet now only contributes to the Old World's downfall.",
    "Tinker" : "They thought they could stop the cyclical collapse of the Old World. Those who survived the Dream Engine's explosion thrash in the ruins of their laboratories, cursing themselves for their failure.",
    "Harmonizer" : "Shortly after the collapse of the Old World, these sentient wisps of billowy white smoke began to dot the ruined landscape. Their cloud-like bodies usually lack substance or form, though the attentive observer may occasionally discern a vaguely quadrupedal, vulpine shape. Lacking the frenzy common to most creatures, they seem to have developed a knack for trade -- though the currency they demand in return for their goods is very sinister indeed.",
    "Cage" : "The final stage of the soulscribing process: a prison formed by pure crystal bars. Within squirms your former companion, its identity remodeled into one of the legendary denizens of the Old World. Their soul has already been cloned millions of times by the Harmony, and had its ideology and thought-patterns turned into mass-produced blueprints. Talented Vessels may channel this piece of eerie Harmonic technology to incarnate these prisoners for a short time.",
    "FluffyCage" : "At first, you believe the cage to be empty, and your travel companion to have been kidnapped - until the wispy clouds behind the bars begin meshing together, assembling themselves into an atomically identical clone of the Serene Harmonizer. True to her name, she does not display a speck of anguish, and only watches your every move with an eerie grin.",
    "Peacemaker" : "A half-second was all it took to expunge all trace of individuality and identity from the victim, and transform it into an atomically identical clone of the Serene Harmonizer. How disturbing.",
    "Hologram" : "A floating hologram, dancing in the dark air of the World Seed. Through the Saints' finest technology, it constantly emits electromagnetic frequencies perfectly tuned to the chatter of Terminal's neurons, meshing the Saints' thoughts with your own.",
    "Abazon" : "A cracked, antique automaton, seemingly dug out from the wall as if it had always been encased there. It lashes out at all who approach it, with the exception of the one who freed it from its prison.",
    "Oracle" : "A little black and white wolf-like creature, constantly trembling with every single one of its weak muscles. Its divinatory powers have already allowed it to witness the eternal silence that will soon engulf the Old World - a vision that torments it at every waking moment. To survive, it discharges its fear into hapless bystanders, shocking them with a fraction of the Oracle's anguish.",
    "Snail" : "As one of the elusive organics to serve among Ordered souls, this gastropod has experience with shooting energy beams at fallen warriors to bring them back on their wheels... or thrusters. Its extreme slowness prevents it from moving of its own accord in combat, but the turbo-charged reactor mounted on its back is there to help.",
    "Ragemaw" : "The first thing nocturnal hunters of the Old World learned in their training was \"Do not make a sound.\" Even the slightest snap of a twig inflames the Ragemaws with undying fury, dashing at all that breathes with their ectoplasmic stinger. Only in absolute silence can they finally be pacified, and turned into a viscous, delicious blue gel.",
    "Husk" : "An animated corpse, bound to the will of Rasel for as long as she remains at the commands of your psyche. With every kill, they perform a short bow, which the fresh corpse soon imitates in turn.",
    "Slug" : "A robotic mollusk, occasionally stopping to dispense a mass-fabricated set of automatic cuffs. Foolish organics who'd attempt to escape prisons guarded by Ordered souls would eventually find themselves tied up in one such dastardly trap, and forced to recite a pledge to the Saints' Grace before returning to their cell.",
    "Monk" : "Through repeated self-directed insults and mantras of worthlessness, the Annihilationists achieved the impossible, and expunged their own soul. Fully dedicated to the incarnation of one of the six spiritual castes, these mages have long forgotten the meaning of existence.",
    "Felidol" : "Grinning eternally at some cosmic joke only they seem to understand, these feline statues once served as protectors of merchants and slavers. Deprived of purpose, they filled the rivers with coins, and marched on these golden bridges to usurp the Reality Anchor, dreaming of a Next World ordered in masters and servants.",
    "Weaver" : "One of the many monastic artisans, who enchanted the city streets with their simple songs as their long tongues spun brute materials into beautiful crafts. This one seems to have remained oblivious to the Old World's collapse, endlessly repeating the same three notes while it folds pages from old books into elegant pinwheels. Its trance prevents it from feeling pain -- until you dare damage one of its precious creations, that is.",
    "Rendfly" : "Once the Rend-Plague outbreak has spread to the headlines of every holoscreen, the population began to exterminate en masse these pesky little insects. Of the millions that caused the epidemic, only a few dozens remain, but the Old World's end has not tempered their terrifying mind-altering bite one bit.",
    "ModuleOrb" : "Within this pure crystal sphere swirls a billowy, white gas, in which swarm fragments of the Collective's technological prowess. A single breath suffices to grant some ability normally reserved for Harmonic kin, though your mind may not remain fully your own following installation of this strange cybernetic.",
    // Tiles
    "Floor" : "A long time ago, legions of monks carved holy symbols on each floortile of the palaces, so they may be worthy of being treaded by the Saints' steps. Decades of dust has undone the tireless work of these artists.",
    "Seal" : "The Saints feared Terminal would try to escape before the end times. They locked down their royal chambers, trading convenience for the peace of mind that their ticket to immortality would not run away in the middle of the night.",
    "OpenSeal" : "The gate has opened, revealing the arrays of pistons and tubes within. One seal broken, one more nail in the coffin of the Old World.",
    "HarmonicSeal" : "This broken seal's machinery betrays its Collectivist allegiance, as its intricate gears and wires have been replaced with an array of mechanical flutes repeating the same note over and over.",
    "PosRelay" : "An eerie cyan crystal cube, humming alongside the Collective's song. Fleeting visions of polished marble halls dance within, indicating it may serve as a transporter to a distant location.",
    "NegRelay" : "An ominous red crystal cube, pulsating alongside the Collective's song. Fleeting visions of diamond-blue fountains swirl within, indicating it may act as a transporter to a distant location.",
    "Barrier" : "The Saints thought they'd be safe in their palaces at the end times, locked behind the most expensive and durable materials they could pay for. They were dead wrong.",
    "Warp" : "The cyclical collapses of the Old World always leave matter intact. Instead, various pockets of spirit-void, in which souls cannot exist, begin to grow in random locations, violently repositioning any consciousness found within towards a safe location. It seems this room is about to be populated by the victims of one such event. When the void will have swallowed all, the Old World will fall silent forever.",
    "Circuit" : "You have no idea what these computers were even meant to calculate. What you do know, however, is that your dull claws could not pierce their shiny rubber coating, no matter how many times you tried.", //
    "TermiSeal" : "They warned you the vault door would only open at the end times. If its pistons have been fully pulled back, and the hiss of its steam engine is beckoning you forward, that can only mean one thing.", //
    "Soulscribe" : "Do not be fooled by the shining gold plating - this grisly piece of machinery is capable of expunging all traces of personality and identity from its hapless occupant, and rewriting their soul into a fundamentally different individual. Only the Harmony could have conjured such a disturbing piece of equipment.",
    "Siphon" : "The fragments of a broken Felidol, still greedily tugging at imaginary wealth despite having lost their soul. Should a creature be slain on top of the shards, the Felidol will be reassembled, its iconic grin restored to a pure, shining white.",
    "Mine" : "All the haunting blueprints of unfinished projects from an Artistic soul, compressed into a devastating pellet of psychic energy. Should an enemy step on it, beams of raw regret will pierce all 4 cardinal directions, lashing at the psyche of all foes that stand in their way.",
    "HMine" : "All the haunting blueprints of unfinished projects from an Artistic soul, compressed into a devastating pellet of psychic energy. Should you or an ally step on it, beams of raw regret will pierce all 4 cardinal directions, lashing at the psyche of all friendly creatures that stand in their way.",
    "Bundle" : "A dastardly metallic creation, constantly looking out for the thermic signature of an organic creature passing over it. Once it has spotted its victim, strands of liquid rubber shoot out to envelop the hapless passer-by's feet, and knock them prone while they struggle to undo their bindings.",
    "Pinwheel" : "An impeccable little handicraft, gently swirling as gusts of wind sway over it. You doubt its maker would appreciate the destruction of such a delicate thing.",
    "Reality" : "A pocket of unreality, void of the concept of void itself. Your gaze fills it with your flawed preconceptions of what nonexistence must be like - to you, it is a sparkling expanse of starry lights, dancing among the nothingness. To try to step within this space would be just like trying to rewind time before the birth of time: impossible.",
    "Glamour" : "A puff of swirling pink gas, occasionally scintillating as if it were filled with metallic confetti. A single breath crushes the divide between the real and the illusory - a fraction of the power that caused the Roseic Metropolis' inhabitants to fall so easily.",
    "Roseic" : "A monolithic mass of pink glass, its monotony broken by a complex maze-like pattern spreading within. Its alluring colours and patterns invite you to find an exit to this impossible, titanic puzzle - an offer to be denied, should you wish to remain alive.",
    "Rose" : "As Last to Rule the Old World, Rose represents the apex of the slow descent into leisure and egoism that struck the Saints' Dynasty. Under his iconic marching band uniform, the gears and cogs of his many mechanical augmentations whirr in eerie unison.",
    "RoseS" : "A once proud individual, whose willpower and strength of character have long been drained away by the pink twine constricting their body. From the edge of your sight, you swear you occasionally spot Rose himself taking the place of one of his servants, smiling mischievously at your surprise.",
    "RoseSpawn" : "A teletransporter, randomly hauling Rose's most loyal subjects into his circus. The lottery fliers claimed they'd be granted a chance at ascension into the Next World, as long as they swore to extend the Roseic dominion into the realities beyond.",

    "JOLTZAZON" : "When the youth took too long to find a partner, their guardians would tell them the tale of Joltzazon, who married a river out of disinterest for his kin, and eventually drowned in it. In his honour, the tea savoured by the newly-wed is prepared from the waters of this stream.",
    "PURPIZUG" : "Dozens of rivers have been used up in paint, and yet, this mad artist has never completed a single work. Every time a near-perfect masterpiece was about to be completed, it met its fate drowned in an ocean of white colour, soon to be covered by yet another ephemeral creation.",
    "ROSE" : "The final emperor to rule the Old World, more preoccupied with the best way to wear scarves and frilled robes than with the imminent end of reality. Some accused his narcissism to have seeped out of his mind, and given form to the first Serene Collectivist. Those dissenters spent the rest of their days tangled in pink ribbons, grinning brightly in pride at their new positions as palace servants.",

    "AUBE" : "A weak and ineffectual kit, enlisted in the Saints' royal guard because of an unfortunate misunderstanding. He seemed to care a lot more about cooking than fighting, and his tablets were scribbled with imaginary recipes requiring ingredients from the Edge of Reality.",
    "ZENITH" : "Years of harsh training and re-education have expunged all traces of kindness from Aube, who then learned how to cut viscera instead of fruit. His enemies whispered his name with anguish, and even his fellow soldiers feared his notorious cruelty.",

    "SHIZAPIS" : "A mute slime-otter, who held a fortune-telling booth at the Edge of Reality. Holographic prophecies constantly poured out from the projector-crystal floating above her head, warning travellers of \"variables\", \"functions\" or \"if statements\". The existential distress she caused in her most faithful visitors eventually caused her practice to be outlawed.",
    "ABAZON" : "A mechanical clay sentinel, tasked to protect the Reality Anchor's cell until the end times. As technology progressed, the prison walls thickened with steel and concrete, but Abazon refused to budge from its post, and was soon engulfed. Rumour says it still stands there, immured and paralyzed, waiting to strike out with extreme prejudice at any who'd dare dig out its tomb.",
    "LASHOL" : "A tiny sea urchin, artificially grown in the Saints' aquariums. At every single passing second, it directed a portion of its nutrition towards accumulating charge in a hidden bio battery, eventually unleashing it on its unsuspecting predators. Once used to play the most legendary cushion-on-chair prank ever among the Saints, its existence was made illegal shortly thereafter.",
    "ZAINT" : "Before the gears and steam pistons took over, Zaint's teachings made the Old World go round, sowing a doctrine of tolerance and modesty in his many followers. If the First Saint were to discover the luxurious palaces of the modern era, and their many vices, he would no doubt... smile, and comment on the inevitable decay of all things.",
    "RASEL" : "A modest puppeteer, selling dolls in a dark corner of the Metropolis. Repeated inhalation of Saints' Breath eventually convinced her that her soul transcended beyond much more than just her body, granting her control over soulless corpses as if it were her own flesh. She was chased to the Edge of Reality, where soldiers eventually defeated her after slicing their former comrades in half.",
    "BOREORA" : "An extremely popular singer... without a single vocal cord. Every single time she got on the stage, pretending to weave verse after verse of the most beautiful poetry anyone had ever heard, her fans cheered her so loudly to the point of drowning out her nonexistent song. As her agent kept insisting in marketing campaigns that only the noblest souls could actually hear her, nobody ever called out her lie.",
    "ASPHA" : "At one point in the history of Old World warfare, use of camouflage and invisibility technology became omnipresent. The solution was, of course, to build a very energy-hungry robot that considers air itself as its mortal enemy. Overkill? The stealth-bots - or, at the very least, what remains of them - would disagree.",
    "NAIA" : "As the weight of the years piled onto the citizens of the Old World, their capability for production of value decreased, and with it, their rank within society. An altruistic inventor thus began building the Naia model, a cuddly quadrupedal companion robot whose truth and beliefs corresponded to what was being said to it. And so, as the elderly snored in their dust-encrusted hospital rooms, Naia dreamt of being brought into great adventures by its \"young\", \"healthy\" and \"renowned\" masters.",
    "EZEZZA" : "A legendary parasite attracted to hosts thinking of it. As the cure to this strange disease was simply to find a way to entertain one's mind away from the worm's presence, patients reported greatly increased moods after being cleansed of its influence. Ezezza eventually became aware of its own existence, perishing instantly.",
    "ASTER" : "Saint Rose's exiled son, ostracized due to his pupils of ill-matched colours. After trawling through the shady districts of the Metropolis, the disgraced noble finally found his new purpose: an enforcer of diversity, a comforter of the different, and a warrior battling in the name of Dissonance. Why would the Harmony authorize such a dangerous soul?",
    "GYVJI" : "All contenders of the Saints' Arena feared Gyvji's mythical tail slap, supposedly so strong it could knock your soul out of your body and into the crowd, leaving the body untouched. Thankfully, it wasn't long until reality caught up, causing the victim's flesh to charge into the hopefully empty seats of the stadium, where it would be rejoined with its distraught spirit.",
    "KASHIA" : "The first day of her infection, many wondered why Kashia waited five seconds to respond after being asked the most basic questions. After being brought for inspection to a dream-healer, her family gasped in horror at the apparent lack of a soul within her body. Their throats breathed sighs of relief when a little ghostly Kashia arrived five seconds later to mesh with the lizard's flesh, seemingly forever cursed to remain an after-image.",
