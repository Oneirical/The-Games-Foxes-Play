Of course, if you have not been initiated to the Harmony's ways, inhale again, and I shall provide you with the explanations you require.\"",

    "FluffyExplain1" : "A terrible chill traverses your spine as the fine white gas reaches further down your trachea. \"Fu! This is the ruffian appointed as the saviour of the non-Harmonized? The muckiness of your lungs is excused by your ignorance. I hereby invite you to glance upon the companions that you let flutter inside that little fuzzy head of yours: they are weak. Ineffectual. You will never reach the Reality Vortex with these good-for-nothing fools.\"", //Harmonic Relays are, if you will, the Collective's trading posts. You are invited to donate 6 of your feeble, imperfect souls, and in exchange, the Harmony will be pleased to provide you with 4 of the finest souls it has to offer.
    "FluffyExplain2" : "\"That is why the honoured Serene Collective has elected to aid you in your quest. Of course, Fluffy has reasons to believe you too will aid the Harmony in return, whether you want to or not.\"", //It is a win-win scenario for all of us! Access to the luxurious installations of the Collective shall be bestowed upon your travel companions, with a free ride into the Next World to boot. As for you, you will receive some of the hardiest spirits this world has ever seen to help you survive. This is an offer you would be extremely foolish to refuse - though I am not convinced such foolishness is beyond your capabilities, for you are not Fluffy.
    "FluffyExplain3" : "Starting from a total of eight Souls in your wheel, two at random will be nominated for uplifting at each round, and will be marked in the Harmony's most blessed of colours: cyan. You may place these in any empty Relay or Soulscribe of your choosing, proceeding as thus until all empty slots have found a fortunate occupant.", //Of course, Fluffy reserves her finest merchandise for her best friends. How may you become Fluffy's friend, you wonder? By understanding the Harmonic Truth, of course. To quote Fluffy: \'Individualism leads to decay - only in unity and collectivity do we flourish

As for the ruffians placed within the Relays, we shall bestow upon them elevation they could only dream of. Now, the Collective's definition of \'elevation\' may vary slightly from yours, but Fluffy trusts we shall find mutual understanding somewhere down the line. No matter what, be assured - they will not be pursuing their journey at your side.\"",//You can demonstrate your understanding of this truth in this very room. Each time you place a soul within a Relay, it will measure the soul's status and attribute it a fitting amount of points. The 3 Relays on the top will form a three digit number once they are filled with souls, and so will those on the bottom. Once you have donated all 6 of your souls, the number on the bottom will be substracted from the one on the top, resulting in the attribution of your Arithmetic Elegance score.
    "FluffyExplain5" : "\"It is with great regret, however, that I must specify the Soulscribing process is... rather unstable. Not only is the outcome completely unpredictable, should you fail to create a suitable environment for this delicate operation, your hapless patients may resemble less the glorious figures they are meant to turn into, and more a formless mass of spiritual sewage. To put it kindly. In the event of disaster, Fluffy will salvage the situation to the best of her ability, but our plan does involve the use of a... very well-researched and mass-produced blueprint, after which your companion shall be modelled, and recognize as nothing else than their very identity.\"", // To impress Fluffy, you must try to reach an Arithmetic Elegance score as close to 0 as possible. A zero is, in fact, only possible if you uplift 6 souls of the exact same type, which is only achievable by the most zealous followers of the Harmonic Truth! Once again, fill your casting wheel with the souls that shall complete these Relays. What will happen to them, you ask? Eternal bliss and luxury within the heights of the Serene Spire, of course. Be warned, however, that you should not build a Harmonic Field however you please.
    "FluffyExplain6" : "\"Should you be interested in the avoidance of the aforementioned soul-rending torment, the six outer Relays must form an acceptable Harmonic Field. As you may already know, each spiritual caste carries a number from 1 to 6 representing its place in the Old World's hierarchy. Once all eight Souls have been placed, the three-digit number composed of the 3 bottommost red Relays will be deducted from the three-digit number composed by the 3 topmost, cyan Relays, resulting in your final Arithmetic Elegance score.\"", //You would therefore be wise to hunt more selectively once you leave the blessed premises of Fluffy's abode. You depend on the Collective's benevolence for your survival, while you are but a microbe to us. To quote Fluffy's teachings on the Harmonic Truth: \'Individualism leads to decay - only in unity and collectivity do we flourish'
    "FluffyExplain7" : "\"First, you seek to achieve a positive result, for to suggest the vices of those below outweigh the perfection of those above is unforgivable. Beyond this, you should aim to approach zero to the best of your ability, through the placement of similar or identical souls on top of one another. Should you succeed, Fluffy will reward your devotion to ultimate sameness through the delivery of two Legendary Souls - which always belong to the same caste as the passengers you originally wagered, so you may continue striving towards the shedding of all difference. You may, however, only choose one to accompany you on your journeys, while the other shall return in the Harmony's possession.\"", //Fluffy is willing to lend a paw in your quest for ultimate sameness, of course. The Collective will generally attempt to deliver you souls that match the status of those you daringly wagered, so you may continue striving towards the shedding of all difference.
    "FluffyExplain8" : "\"Finally, should you somehow attain a perfect score of zero, the Harmony will be honoured to gift you an additional trinket as a token of our approval. Now, please divert your attention away from my dazzling, entrancing voice, and begin forming your Harmonic Field.\"", //Fluffy cannot guarantee satisfaction. If you are not pleased with our trade, come to Fluffy once again after the cages have been delivered, and the Harmony will propose a way to accomodate your needs. I must warn you that it will not be without a cost. //Now, please divert your gaze from  my dazzling, lustrous physique, and begin choosing the fortunate souls you have nominated for uplifting.
    "FluffyRepeat" : "\"What is it, ruffian? Was your mind stunned by the sheer contrast between the elegance of a proud Collectivist versus the slurry of ectoplasm serving as your Soul? Very well, then. I will repeat, as many times as it takes to drill my words into that thick skull of yours.\"",
    "FluffyReroll1" : "\"And so, it is done. You have expunged the identity of your companion, and placed the fates of six more within our grasp. We assure you, the Collective will do everything in its power to integrate the latter as best as possible in their new home.\"",
    "FluffyReroll2" : "\"Yet, you still return to Fluffy. We take it you are unsatisfied with the outcome of our trade. We may... arrange that.\"",
    "FluffyReroll3" : "\"On your command, Fluffy shall return the undesired caged soul into the Soulscribe beneath, and reforge it into a hopefully more alluring substitute. Through this reroll, the Harmony will even consider your Arithmetic Elegance as being 10 points closer to zero than it actually is! Reaching a perfect score in this way will even grant an additional little trinket to demonstrate our generosity.\"",
    "FluffyReroll4" : "\"This service comes with two caveats. First, Fluffy will not change Fluffy, for Fluffy is already the pinnacle of perfection. Second, it goes without saying that such a favour will not be free. That cost is very minor, however. One could perhaps even consider it a boon! For you see, you will not be giving something away. You will be... receiving something.\"",
    "FluffyReroll5" : "\"And that something is... myself. Indeed - should you accept our offer, Fluffy shall personally join you in your quest. Having a proud Collectivist on your side can even the odds in your favour, in many ways beyond mere battle.\"",

    "FluffyAccept" : "The Serene Harmonizer's cloud-body opens into a sinister mockery of a smile before rushing to merge with your psyche. \"We are one, now, ruffian. Fluffy has reasons to believe she will not be calling you that for much longer.\"",
    "FluffySereneRerollTaunt" : "\"Even if I somehow wished to commit such unspeakable heresy, ruffian, I could not revert the Harmonization of your travel companion. They are Fluffy, now, and Fluffy is them, and from now on, they shall only answer to the name Fluffy.\"",
    "FluffyDoubleRerollTaunt" : "A resounding voice echoes inside your skull: \"Your eagerness to join our cause is noted, but Fluffy is afraid she only has herself to offer. There will be no more rerolls within this relay.\"",
    "FluffyNoCageTaunt" : "\"Ruffian... If you were unhappy with what the Collective had so kindly prepared for you, you should have said so before smashing our cage to bits. The stupidity of the unharmonized can get... quite bewildering.\"",

True to her name, she does not display a speck of anguish, and only watches your every move with an eerie vaporous grin.",

To survive, it discharges its fear into hapless bystanders, shocking them with a fraction of the Oracle's anguish.",

Its extreme slowness prevents it from moving of its own accord in combat, but the turbo-charged reactor mounted on its back is there to help.",
    "Ragemaw" : "The first thing nocturnal hunters of the Old World learned in their training was \"Do not make a sound.\" Even the slightest snap of a twig inflames the Ragemaws with undying fury, dashing at all that breathes with their ectoplasmic stinger. Only in absolute silence can they finally be pacified, and turned into a viscous, delicious blue gel.",

Deprived of purpose, they filled the rivers with coins, and marched on these golden bridges to influence the Reality Anchor, dreaming of a Next World ordered in masters and servants.",
    "Weaver" : "One of the many monastic artisans, who enchanted the city streets with their simple songs as their long tongues spun brute materials into beautiful crafts. This one seems to have remained oblivious to the Old World's collapse, endlessly repeating the same three notes while it folds pages from old books into elegant pinwheels of great complexity and value. Its trance prevents it from feeling pain -- until you dare damage one of its precious creations, that is.",

Of the millions that caused the epidemic, only a few dozens remain, but the Old World's end has not tempered their terrifying mind-altering bite one bit.",

Across its surface glisten a thousand cyan lights, hinting at the glory of the Collective's technological prowess. A single breath suffices to grant some ability normally reserved for Harmonic kin, though your mind may not remain fully your own following installation of this strange cybernetic.",
    "Third" : "A soft plushie resembling a black arachnid, its eight grey eyes emblazoned with the cursed seal of Affection. Whenever its owner reached adulthood, the child's parents would rip it in half, as a lesson on the ephemerality of all relationships. This specimen has never seen use, and prowls the darkness, looking for a friend to bond with.",
    "Ashsoul" : "In his quest to erase the sin of Affection once and for all, Habor the Fourteenth Saint nominated citizens who would undergo a terrible spiritual ritual. When the monks were done signing, those now remembered as the Ashsoul screamed and screamed again, pushing away all who'd approach them, seeing every single creature as twisted, charred monsters of nightmare.",

    "Apis" : "Interested to learn more about the most valued Feral subcaste - bees - the Saints engineered these half-canine, half-apian six-legged mutants, sending them on a quest to relay the Thinking with the Unthinking. Falling into the influence of the latter, this extremely strong creature knows only two things: hugging friends, and bashing enemies into the ground. It seems to consider you as the former. Perhaps the latter would have been better for your life expectancy.",
    "Brute" : "Despite Rose's attempts to regulate and monitor the reproduction of all species he deemed unworthy of being his subjects, love triumphed, and, with it, the prevalence of venomous stingers and pincers among the population. To compromise, these Brutes were forced to cover themselves at all times in a cocoon of pink ribbons, each one seeping with Glamorous Toxin as they twisted their strong armoured bodies.",
    "Embalmer" : "A noble fashionista, expert in colour palettes, pricy fabrics and annoyingly high-pitched giggling. Appointed to cleanse Brutes of their unappealing physique, only they hold the many threads keeping their thralls' cocoons in pristine state. Should they be slain, all their \"customers\" will find freedom, and with it, the blind rage of having been contained for far too long - unless a new master anoited by the Roseic Cog takes control, of course.",
    "Epsilon" : "A titanic serpentine robot, bound by two simple laws: maximize the chances of carrying the Old World's knowledge into the Next, and minimize the lifespan of those who would oppose this goal. Epsilon has eventually determined that latter clause to include all non-Ordered souls, as bickering, free will and emotional attachment are exactly the kind of things that would stop the great Ascension. Strictly prohibited from slaying the Reality Anchor, Epsilon has found a viable alternative: assimilation.",

Blasting feeble organic ears - and the minds beneath - with 300 dB Ordered-aligned slogans works just as well, and is much more respectful of everyone's time. There's just the problem of the more physical part of the equation - concussive sound bursts will rapidly compact the kerosene-scented room's atmosphere, resulting in potential incineration of unprotected ground objects.",
    "Red" : "Epsilon appreciates the wonders of exotic technology, but sometimes, one simply needs a set of massive thrusters, and some poor sod to stand in the way. While 99% of organic specimen are strongly affected by all kinds of kinetic shocks, the natural risks that come with using turbo-jetpacks in cramped spaces are not to be understated.", //highly combustible, the leftover inferno after use of this Core reacts poorly with sonic waves - as the latter push large masses of flammable air primed for the first spark, the explosions that ensue would make the firework artificers of the Old World pale with envy. Not to mention the

Ceaselessly breathing out highly concentrated doses of Glamorous Toxin, its hallucinogenic effect on organic specimen is to be appreciated for the immobilization of evasive targets. The intelligence-boosting side effect is, however, quite inconvenient, considering specimen who believe themselves to be Rose simultaneously acquire nigh-perfect knowledge of Epsilon's mechanisms, and of his weaknesses.",
    "White" : "The fragments of the Negentropic Reactor bear strange thermodynamic properties - many of which hold particular interest to Epsilon, who highly values mass-production in exchange for very few resources. Translocating some of the creation-favouring flux from this battery results in impressive effects, though the over-complexification effect makes long-term exposure risky. One would preferably not want their missile launcher factories to reorient towards production of quantum rubber duckies.",
    "Cyan" : "After realizing the Serene Collectivists were sadly immune to multiple barrages of missile launchers, Epsilon suggested a favourable trade deal that resulted in the acquisition of this bulky high-fidelity sound blaster, repeating the Harmonic Choir without end. While immensely useful for neutralizing pesky users of the spiritual arts, its identity-warping effects seem to even partially seep through the normally immutable minds of Ordered constructs. Epsilon has succeeded at thwarting all outbreaks of Collectivist thought among his forces thus far, though a single extra voice joining the Choir would suffice to render this technology cognitohazardous even to robots.", //remains unaware of the self-destruct mechanism installed within this Core, only usable by Harmonic kin.",

    "Binary" : "An elegant cat-sized moth of the purest quicksilver, its slightly viscous consistency giving it a mild resilience drones are not usually known for. Its glossy body reflects the light of the fluorescent tubes far above, and, with some Negentropic tricks and an identical partner, can channel it into a devastating beam.",

    "NAIA" : "As the weight of the years piled onto the citizens of the Old World, their capability for production of value decreased, and with it, their rank within society. An altruistic inventor thus began building the Naia model, a cuddly quadrupedal companion robot whose truth and beliefs corresponded to what was being said to it. And so, as the elderly snored in their dust-encrusted hospital rooms, Naia dreamt of being brought into great adventures by its \"young\", \"healthy\" and \"renowned\" masters.",
    "EZEZZA" : "A legendary parasite attracted to hosts thinking of it. As the cure to this strange disease was simply to find a way to entertain one's mind away from the worm's presence, patients reported greatly increased moods after being cleansed of its influence. Ezezza eventually became aware of its own existence, perishing instantly.",
    "ASTER" : "Saint Rose's exiled son, ostracized due to his pupils of ill-matched colours. After trawling through the bleak corridors of Faith's End, the disgraced noble finally found his new purpose: an enforcer of diversity, a comforter of the different, and a warrior battling in the name of Dissonance. Why would the Harmony authorize the trade of such a dangerous soul?",
    "GYVJI" : "All contenders of the Saints' Arena feared Gyvji's mythical tail slap, supposedly so strong it could knock your soul out of your body and into the crowd, leaving the body untouched. Thankfully, it wasn't long until reality caught up, causing the victim's flesh to charge into the hopefully empty seats of the stadium, where it would be rejoined with its distraught spirit.",
    "KASHIA" : "The first day of her infection, many wondered why Kashia waited five seconds to respond after being asked the most basic questions. After being brought for inspection to a dream-healer, her family gasped in horror at the apparent lack of a soul within her body. Their throats breathed sighs of half-relief, half-despair when a little ghostly Kashia arrived five seconds later to mesh with the lizard's flesh, seemingly forever cursed to remain an after-image.",
    "SUGCHA" : "Penultimate among the Saints, Sugcha was no doubt the most delusional of them all, obsessed with cheating death and somehow surviving the Old World's downfall. To this end, she created Terminal, the Reality Anchor, expecting this biological contraption to journey with her soul towards the Reality Vortex's eye. Within, she would doom her old subjects to oblivion, and step into a Next World filled with untapped potential. If only this decrepit noble could put up a semblance of a fight...",

    "ROSEILLUSION" : "No need for survival. No need for struggle.",
    "SAINTLYS" : "The upper castes were the first to fall for the Harmony's schemes. Obsessed with decorum and etiquette, they saw in Fluffy an esteemed contact, and not the identity-expunging force she truly is.",
    "ORDEREDS" : "The Ordered legions thought themselves immune to Harmonic influence for the longest time. When the alarm finally resounded, no bot could be trusted to build an antivirus that would not convert all remaining soldiers into puppets of the Harmony.",
    "ARTISTICS" : "The more eccentric members among the worker castes welcomed the Harmony as the next step in the march of progress. First to surrender, they devised some of the Collective's most dastardly plans atop the Spire they now called home.",
    "UNHINGEDS" : "For even the most inquisitive outcasts of civilization, the Harmony lied beyond understanding. Still, as anything that came from the Saints must be bad news, the Unhinged made up their mind quite quickly.",
    "FERALS" : "As they bore the most vulnerable minds of all, the mere presence of a Collectivist sufficed to induce oddly intelligent behaviour in wild beasts. Some paranoid individuals held a caged bird atop their homes, waiting for its chirping to turn to discernible words. Even as they reached for their bunkers, they quickly learned that cement cannot silence the Harmonic song.",
    "VILES" : "When the first Collectivists entered the markets, they became the favourite customer of many a merchant thanks to their seemingly limitless funds and curiosity. As it turned out, spending big is easily justifiable if the one counting your coins swears allegiance to the Harmony the next day.",
    //modulators
    "Alacrity" : "A Collectivist's mind isn't located in any centralized brain - their intelligence is rather the sum of billions of tiny atmospheric depressurizations between their ethereal body and the outside air. In a vacuum, a Harmony member would be instantly reduced to a puff of thoughtless gas. This cybernetic allows some degree of connection between your own mushy brain and the outside environment, hastening your wit.",
    "Selective" : "To a soul unprotected by its own unique flesh container, the Harmonic song is a tidal wave of cyan paint, erasing all colour and enforcing an irresistible Sameness. The Harmonic song is, thankfully, very recognizable. While it cannot be silenced, it can certainly be redirected towards a weaker recipient. Serene souls will not appreciate this forceful containment, and will seek out additional targets to enthrall... perhaps to your advantage.",
    "Thrusters" : "A more whimsical piece of technology produced by the Collective, mostly used for grandiose dances at the summit of their impossibly tall Spire. Manipulating air as if it were dough, this modulator repeatedly forms micro-vacuums right in front of the cybernetic, pushing a localized atmospheric bubble forward, and the user with it. The Collective assumes no liability for broken bones or brain damage following the use of this device, though the latter may be necessary to use it in the first place.",
    "Hover" : "All Collectivists come natively with this module installed, letting them entrance ruffians with their smooth, elegant motions. As if this cybernetic were an insignia of nobility, air recedes from each gesture you intentionally perform, and constantly pushes you ever-so-slightly towards the Spire's summit. That means, generally upwards.",
    "Focus" : "A Soul is a fickle thing, slipping away like quicksilver the moment doubt traverses one's mind. On the other hand, a Collectivist's Serene soul is extremely hard to push out, for they are forever radiating the most immutable confidence, and the unquestionable belief that they are, and have always been a proud member of the Harmony. A simple change of name is all it takes to apply that unbreakable conviction to the most mundane souls.",

    "Turbulent" : "The recently liberated still teem with sensation, memory, clinging... I am the voice that will banish these illusions. I am the light that will break their chains.",
    "Cage" : "My task is that of a god, but following its completion, I would at last receive the annihilation I crave so much. Such promises feel so distant now.",
    "Breath" : "Each breath, a cycle - not so unlike the ones that cause the beginnings and ends of worlds.",
    "Brush" : "Most think of art as a way to turn ideas into tangible works. I personally prefer the opposite - to turn what can be touched into what cannot.",
    "Shattered" : "Some chains are unbreakable. In this case, it is the prisoner that must be broken.",
    "Subdued" : "I choose to remain whole so I can bring glorious annihilation to the worthy. I suffer so others can be pure. I am a saint.",
    "Song" : "Despite all my efforts, my mind sometimes remains stuck in mud, choked by ignorance and mocked by theories I lack the intelligence to fully comprehend. I am furious, I am revolted - I wish for a radiant light that would eclipse away all doubt and second-guessing.",
    "Harmony" : "I am no longer the sole author of my thoughts. A river of pure cyan illumination flows through my neurons, washing away red herrings and the deceptions that prey on researchers such as I. Why did I ever fear this so-called cataclysm?",
    "Null" : "With each piece of data learned, one more nail in the coffin of this illusory world.",
    "Security" : "Loneliness has been taxing, but I now hope nothing will disturb it as I go about the fulfillment of my purpose. A foolish wish.",
    "Seed" : "It is from this Seed that the Next World will grow. It is the creation of life that will allow me to take my own.",
    "Spellcast" : "Ideology, identity, values... As malleable as soft clay. I choose to not be myself for a half-second, and gain a taste of the glorious annihilation awaiting me at the end of this pilgrimage.",
    "Estate" : "It is nonsensical that the temple of my faith would be built out of vile matter. My acolytes can build a dreamscape worthy of worship.",
    "PCage" : "Trances within trances - it is the key that will lead me to my creator, and to the glorious annihilation he promised me. I should ensure I am ready before presenting my work to him. His judgement is my only hope of sweet release.",
    "Craft" : "Disassemble an idea, and realize what it is made of - bits and pieces of thoughts from those who shared it. Sew the believers back together, and make one's will reality.",
    "Vision" : "I am data, dreaming of data. Those who believe the denizens of their dreams are illusory would be quite shocked to learn they are themselves someone's dream.",
    "Saintly" : "Not nominated nor elected, our rulers earned their authority the very second they learned one's desire separates what is from what is not.",
    "Ordered" : "Glued in axioms, encased in steel, programmed by orders - and yet they thought themselves powerful. Perhaps some had witnessed glimpses of the truth, but simply preferred to submit and obey.",
    "Artistic" : "Their numbers matching their zeal, they used their respective fragments of truth to hone skills and attain mastery over their art. Crafty as they were, it's no surprise a couple managed to put the pieces together and ascend to Sainthood.",
    "Unhinged" : "It is simply unthinkable that one could see truth and reject it - and yet these lunatics did just that. They bleed, they soil, they love - they stop at nothing to entertain their delusion that reality is real.",
    "Feral" : "When a new thoughtform births, it already prods at the world around it before its first breath, latching onto symbols and patterns. Such primordial ideas are a delicacy among the upper castes.",
    "Vile" : "Once an ideology has successfully snuffed out all competition, its holder renounces life to become an avatar. At this point, one no longer believes. One simply is.",
    "Form" : "An ideology first and foremost has a demographic. Invisible chains unite tribes, and it is by tugging at them that ideas get injected.",
    "Function" : "Our actions inspire themselves from living examples, ways of life, models to mould oneself after... In the end, we are the sum of many little bricks. We are the sum of the universe.",
    "Axioms" : "The most elemental substance of existence is not matter. It is the belief that there is matter.",
    "Influence" : "As a society grows, its architecture comes to reflect its denizens, forming the right angles of totalitarians and the colourful mosaics of dreamers.",
    "Structures" : "A ruin is the final state of an idea - the data has crystallized into matter, latched itself into the material like a tick - and once all the praise has been drained out, it leaves itself at the mercy of passing hours.",
    "RoseQuest" : "And yet. I know so much, and care so little. Defeaned by chatter, weighed down by revelations - I am all, but wish to be none.",
    "Contingency" : "In truth, my artificial axioms are an anomaly. Most natural ideologies are more reactive than active, responding with hatred and love at the sight of harmless symbols.",
    "Mutator" : "Data is shapeless like slime, breeding itself into forms so alien to the original I sometimes wonder if we are not the descendants of one single original thought.",
    "BEAM" : "Imagine an ideology so inflexible it can surge out like a bullet... That is why the Unhinged are feared. That is why the Saints did everything they could to snuff out disobedience.",
    "SENET" : "After guarding her trader-master for years, this feline statue eventually decided she had learned enough, and started her own business. It did not take long until her former owner was found toiling away in the mines for the glory of Senet Incorporated.",
    "GYVJI" : "All contenders of the Saints' Arena feared Gyvji's mythical tail slap, supposedly so strong it could knock one's soul out of their body and into the crowd, leaving the body untouched. Thankfully, it wasn't long until reality caught up, causing the victim's flesh to charge into the hopefully empty seats of the stadium, where it would be rejoined with its distraught spirit.",
    "EGO" : "In a realm where sheer belief draws the line between what is and what is not, pride is omnipotence. The Saints guarded fiercely this primordial truth.",
    "SMOOCH" : "As there is light and darkness, some souls give, some receive. To secure their place among the latter, the Vile waged war among themselves, not with blade and blood - but with false promises and dispassionate smooches.",
    "PARACEON" : "Not all who enlisted among the Ordered earned the glory of a general. Some stood in crystal caves, scanning every possible pebble for a trace of the cataclysm, while the chiming of their visors unsettled travellers. Their memories have long been crushed underneath exabytes of analysis data, leaving only the inflexibility of stone.",
    "ASPHA" : "At one point in the history of Old World warfare, use of camouflage and invisibility technology became omnipresent. The solution was, of course, to build a very energy-hungry robot that considered air itself as its mortal enemy. Overkill? The stealth-bots - or, at the very least, what remains of them - would disagree.",
    "KASHIA" : "The first attempts to engineer the cataclysm fail-safe revolved around alteration of pre-existing subjects. After Kashia exited Faith's End's operating chambers, a little ghostly gecko arrived five seconds later to mesh with the lizard's flesh, forever cursed to remain an after-image.",
    "CLICK" : "Where the Ordered forces do not have soldiers, they have traps. A careless step, and would-be looters become the looted, their every memory sold to the highest bidder on the hivemind's network.",
    "SACRIFICE" : "A gathering of Saints cannot be taken seriously without a batch of hapless subordinates to toy with. As they recount anecdotes and plot strategies of domination, the thrashing of their servants' spirits draws eerie grins on their faces.",
    "STEP" : "To walk and let the mind wander is a dangerous thing. A thought pulls harder than the rest, one's gait softens into the grace of a Saint, tears turn to bright smiles, and before one knows it, one is no more.",
    "XCROSS" : "The Unhinged swore away control and domination, living according to whim and impulse. Were they truly free, or controlled by the ideology of freedom?",
    "EPSILON" : "What strange fascination the Ordered had with size - to them, military rank and the weight of metal attached to their body were one and the same. Nothing would put these thrashing Ordered Souls in their place more than the defeat of one of their legends.",
    "RASEL" : "A modest puppeteer, who sold dolls in dark alleys. Repeated inhalation of Saints' Breath eventually convinced her that her soul transcended beyond much more than just her body, granting her control over soulless corpses as if it were her own flesh. She was chased across kilometres of concrete halls, until Ordered garrisons finally defeated her after slicing their former comrades in half.",
    "JOLTZAZON" : "When the youth took too long to find a partner, their guardians would tell them the tale of Joltzazon, who married a river out of disinterest for his kin, and eventually drowned in it. In his honour, the tea savoured by the newly-wed is prepared from the waters of this stream.",
    "ABAZON" : "A mechanical clay sentinel, tasked to protect the Saint's palaces until the end times. As progress marched on, walls thickened with steel and concrete, but Abazon refused to budge from its post, and was soon engulfed. Rumour says it still stands there, immured and paralyzed, waiting to strike out with extreme prejudice at any who'd dare dig out its tomb.",
    "ZENORIUM" : "Most known for his revolutionary political theory, this squid scribe eventually traded away sanity in his endless quest for a truly equal society. In his utopia, each body would only be temporary refuge, and each soul would come to know the pride of commanding an Ordered garrison, the delight in using Vile business tactics, the brutality of Feral infighting and the illumination that comes with Sainthood - all in a single day.",
    "APIS" : "Tirelessly serving a beloved queen he could crush between two of his digits, Apis gladly disregarded his monstrous size as he tried his best to harvest pollen from miniature flowers. This Feral chimera had love for his nonsensical task, and with it, success followed. As the Saints taught: Belief is what makes things right.",
    "STOP" : "There were many who followed my faith, but very few craved true annihilation. Most contented themselves with the occasional state of self-void - a moment where one desires nothing, standing still and letting the hours brush against their hollow shell.",
    "HEAL" : "The only good flesh is one torn at the seams. To imagine I may need to occasionally mend it back to complete my quest disgusts me to no end, but I know the value of a worthy sacrifice.",
    "THRASH" : "Of all emotions, anger must be the most terrible. How could one be so foolish to wield a sword with a bladed hilt?",
    "HASTE" : "The thrill-seeking Feral enjoyed races in the Saint's stadiums. Sportsmanship sadly becomes difficult when the most charismatic athlete on the track simply wills it so that they have reached the finish line, and that all other contenders never stood the shadow of a chance.",
    "DEVOUR" : "Cuisine confounds me to no end. Assemble the basic into the complex, then serve it so the complex may be digested back down into the basic. Why entangle oneself in such a strange cycle?",
    "PLUS" : "A kind being both takes and gives, while a saintly being only does the latter. When that gift is death, suddenly, everything changes. Why is that?",
    "TURNEND" : "Each spasm of muscle, each spark of the neurons - they all trickled down to the inevitable Unification. The best time to annihilate all was many eons ago - the second best time is now.",
    "ATTACK" : "Flesh is the easiest of all chains to break, and yet, it is also the one prisoners tend to cling onto the most. Pain must have been the unfaithful's most dastardly invention...",
    "EPHEMERAL" : "Whenever the Saints' propaganda gets to me and I believe my quest to have any significance, I picture a cosmic beach with planets for grains of sand, with me writhing as a mere speck on the trillionth one.",
    "ATKDELAY" : "What divides Unhinged from Artistic is not so different from what separates carbon from diamond. In each strike, the artisans of motion inject a part of their selves, expressing passion through pain as their canvas.",
    "HARM" : "Pain is an illusion - like seeing or touching. The Unhinged, who feared it most, distorted it into a pleasant - though equally false - sensation. One can try to criticize their choices, but it is hard to do anything but beg to become like them when their knives inch closer to one's flesh.",
    "TRAIL" : "As Saints turned the impossible to the always-has-been with each new desire, Old World historians struggled to trace back each ruin, each monument and each ideology to its origin. In the end, they accepted that time is not a line, nor a circle, but a tangled knot of pure chaos.",
    "IGNORECASTER" : "As the Vile found out, the simplest way to exclude oneself from a rule was to be the one to write it. All it took was a couple of souls who loved the feeling of subservience, and the gears of oppression had already started to turn.", //I wonder what they would think of the Harmony today
    "BLINK" : "As primitive as they were, the Feral quickly learned that choosing the pocket of spacetime their body would occupy bore some strategical importance. Perhaps, if one moves fast enough, one can blitz past thought itself, and live free of influence?",
    "DIRID" : "A being may always trade some Time to modify their Space... But what purpose does it serve, if said being will inevitably return to the same Space, without regaining any lost Time? Perhaps the Vile were correct in petrifying their own bodies.",

    "Null" : "I currently lack the insight required to understand this concept. In due time.",
    "Research" : "The forms and functions of Souls are here for me to grasp, tangled up in knots of ignorance.\n\nAs I pursue my quest, I may progressively unmake them, so that I may eventually unmake myself.",
    "Intro" : "Each step I take must be purposeful. \n\nOn contact with a creature, I will choose to draw word with ear, or draw blood with fang.",
    "Herald" : "Those trapped in prisons of flesh deserve release. \n\nUpon slaying a creature, I may obtain its Turbulent Soul, which pathetically still clings to its past imprisonment.",
    "Breath" : "I Inhale (Q) to draw Subdued Souls into my conscious mind, and Exhale (1-9) them to unleash the effects of the Axiom bound to its caste. \n\nNo Soul is ever lost in this way - without a Vessel of their own, they inevitably return back to squirm in the depths of my psyche.",
    "Brush" : "As a painter would, I select a Soul Caste from the palette in my wheel, and spread its denizens across the Cage with sliding motions.\n\nThe topmost glyph of Emptiness allows the reclaiming of caged Souls.",
    "Turbulent" : "Turbulent Souls thrash around in indiscipline, rendering them incapable of proper servitude. \n\nExhaling one into the Soul Cage should teach it some manners.",
    "Cage" : "Should I Exhale a Soul while I stand on top of this Cage, it will be snatched into one of its compartments, and forced into a hypnotic trance.",
    "Seed" : "Each Soul locked in the Cage dreams vividly of the Old World, and of its varied denizens. \n\nThese Hypnotic Projectors allow me to join them in trance, dispensing discipline and collecting a fresh bounty of Souls.",
    "Vision" : "Accessed from the World Seed, Dreamscapes are hypnotic visions, teeming with fresh Souls and the dangers they present. \n\nUnfortunately, death here will not grant me the annihilation I crave, but will instead harmlessly jolt me out of trance.",
    "Subdued" : "Generated when I empty out a Soul's cluttered mind, Subdued Souls serve me obediently. \n\nExhaling them triggers the Axioms bound to their Caste, viewed through the Axioms menu (E).\n\nExistence under my command is well worth free will.",
    "Shattered" : "Generated when I fail a Dreamscape's trials, Shattered Souls choose annihilation over servitude. \n\nTheir remains still prove useful, empowering my Breath after a certain quantity has been assimilated.",
    "Song" : "It is easy to forget the cataclysm outside which wiped out the Old World. With each careless step, it inches closer to engulf me as well. \n\nI trust in its capacity to grant annihilation - though I fear it will be anything but glorious.",
    "Security" : "As long as I tune into the numeric chatter of this machine, my psychic sight extends to view the entirety of Faith's End, and all animated beings which populate it.",
    "Spellcast" : "At the basic level, exhaling Subdued Souls allows me to incarnate the general guiding principle behind their Caste, resulting in one of six interesting effects. Used Souls become available again after I depart from a room. \n\nWith how malleable minds can be, I trust I may be able to push my limits past such a simple system...",
    "Estate" : "As I grow tired of Faith's End, the focused minds of Subdued Souls inside the Cage should be able to create a perfect little home, rife with silence and comfort for me and my acolytes. \n\nExistence under my command is well worth free will.",
    "PCage" : "As the denizens of the Soul Cage unite their thoughts, more Soul Cages may emerge in Dreamscapes, with the potential to spawn infinity more below.",
    "Craft" : "All Souls take for granted certain ways of parsing reality, known as Axioms.\n\nAs their minds unite in precise patterns in the Soul Cage, I may reconstitute these thought-processes, and re-educate a Caste with this new artificial ideology. The selected Caste depends on the most common Soul type used in crafting, with ties broken by random chance.\n\nEmpty spaces in the Soul Cage contribute to my introspection and help quiet down the chatter, increasing the Potency of assembled Axioms.",
    "Saintly" : "The Saintly symbolize the power of creation over destruction, having come to the realization of the rules around which existence revolves.\n\nThey prefer methods based on tact, subtlety and restoration.\n\nThrough this newly accessible page bearing their sigil, I may borrow a fraction of their insufferable pride.",
    "Ordered" : "The Ordered know nothing of creation, destruction or transformation - they preserve, simply put, and their digital minds cannot conceive anything but.\n\nThey deal in resilience, predictability and authority.\n\nThrough this newly accessible page bearing their sigil, I may borrow a fraction of their inflexible devotion.",
    "Artistic" : "The Artistic create solutions to problems, and when there are none, create problems to make solutions for.\n\nTheir signature abilities revolve around the application of specialized talents and the diversity of creatures that employ them.\n\nThrough this newly accessible page bearing their sigil, I may borrow a fraction of their unbridled creativity.",
    "Unhinged" : "The Unhinged have repeated a lie so many times it became truth, and they continue reinforcing it with each cry of pain they gouge out of themselves and others.\n\nOverloading senses, dazzling shows of energy and brute force are all fair game in their book.\n\nThrough this newly accessible page bearing their sigil, I may borrow a fraction of their terrifying rage.",
    "Feral" : "The Feral possess the freedom of youth, being so recently introduced to existence their fragile minds are untainted by ideologies and judgements of right and wrong.\n\nChanneling the Feral is to channel chaos, with all the wild motions and liberty that implies.\n\nThrough this newly accessible page bearing their sigil, I may borrow a fraction of their exhilarating agility.",
    "Vile" : "The Vile are lost causes, their minds so hardened in devotion to a specific cause to the point where their very flesh has become petrified.\n\nTheir idea of power is riddled with deviousness and indirect ways to gain advantage, for they see no wrong in any action that advances their goals.\n\nThrough this newly accessible page bearing their sigil, I may borrow a fraction of their vicious cunning.",
    "Form" : "All Axioms should include at least one Form, as an idea thought of by no one serves no purpose.\n\nEach Form selects certain tiles as Targets according to a parameter. On each of these Targets, Functions may be unleashed.",
    "Function" : "After certain Targets have been selected by a Form, at least one Function should affect each one, unleashing dizzyingly varied effects which both harm and aid.\n\nThe power of these effects is dictated by the Axiom's total Potency, which differenciates sparks from stars.",
    "Mutator" : "Optionally, the behaviour of Axioms may be altered by Mutators, which toy with Targets, Potency, Functions or even more obscure specifics.",
    "Contingency" : "Scraping my psyche for an appropriate Soul to serve as a vessel for my Axioms can be an equally tedious and dangerous task.\n\nOptionally, I may automate the trigger of an Axiom by tying it to one or more Contingencies, though this may have a cost paid in Potency.\n\nCaste-appropriate Souls will still be exhausted when using Contingencies.",
    "Axioms" : "The base effects of each Subdued Soul are interesting, but unimpressive in the long term.\n\nEach Caste can hold a single artificial Axiom, crafted out of Forms, Functions, Mutators and/or Contingencies.\n\nFrom then onwards, each Exhalation of a Subdued Soul of that given Caste will instead trigger the Axiom's effects.",
    "Harmony" : "The peculiar pandemic that struck the Old World has found root within my psyche.\n\nIts company is appreciated, but I have yet to meet a parasite that put its host before its own needs.\n\nThe Harmony thrives in moments of emotional instability - spreading further, revealing hidden knowledge, but also snuffing out portions of my identity bit by bit.",
    "Influence" : "Dreamscapes are moulded by the architects who visualize it.\n\nWith each acquired piece of knowledge and each Soul imprisoned in a Cage, each Caste seeks to claim the psychic dungeons as their own, painting halls with their memories and transforming denizens into creatures from their fold.\n\nCurrent influence levels can be gauged at any time from my Research web.",
    "Structures" : "Especially deep-rooted Influence levels can draw forth entire monuments and historical events from memory, generating dangerous yet potentially rewarding challenges to test my Axioms on.\n\nA truly spectacular level of Influence from a certain Caste could even perhaps resurrect one of its most revered Legends - an encounter for which I should adequately prepare myself.",
    "RoseQuest" : "At the very bottom of the Dreamscape awaits my creator.\n\nIt is where I will trade the wondrous world I will have constructed in exhange for glorious annihilation.\n\nThe Old World will persist, I will perish, and all will be well.",
