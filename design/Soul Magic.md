# Soul Magic

Magical spells in TGFP are all about identity and belief. If you convince yourself enough that you are an archmage, then maybe you'll be able to start rolling around some fireballs. Doubt yourself for a half-second, and all artifice vaporizes in an instant.

## Fake It 'Til You Make It (Lore)

Very few are actually able to perform magic on their own, unless they spend decades in self-erasure training and the cultivation of a feeling of supreme worthlessness, only to fill the void in the end with some pure incarnation of a certain belief or ideology. Otherwise, all the subtle nuances possessed by a thinking individual prevent them from achieving the single-minded commitment required to do anything more than some card tricks.

Terminal, however, possesses the uncanny ability to store the souls of the formerly-living in his being. All he needs to perform incredible feats is to let each one possess him for a half-second, *become* them just long enough to work their magic, and then dump them back into the abyss of subconscious memory. In exchange, Terminal is no one, except the sum of all that inhabit him. With a little hardcoded desire to journey to the Reality Vortex somewhere in that mushy brain of his.

## Identity Theft, a Primer (In Game)

In the game, the total number of Souls you own is displayed in the lower right corner, divided in Common, Legendary and Serene tiers. Slaying enemies will award Common souls, completing specific challenges in certain special rooms will grant Legendary souls, and Serene souls are obtained by gambling a little bit too audaciously with the Serene Collective.

As long as you have Souls in storage, you can press "q" to build a line-up of identities you may temporarily assume. You can only equip a maximum of 9 souls at a time in your hotbar, but your storage can have an infinite number. Using "q" will cost 1 Resolve per draw - Resolve is regenerated after each room clear. If you have no more Resolve, you can still draw Souls, but that will cost 1 Ipseity per draw instead.

You can gain more Resolve by sacrificing Souls after death. Souls used in this way are permanently removed.

Pressing the number keys 1-9 will invoke that specific Soul, and execute a special effect alongside it, depending on the soul type that was used. Some souls react differently depending on which branch they are used in, while others are always the same.

That soul is then placed in a "discard" pile, where it will cycle back eventually for usage.

To check what a specific Soul does, drag your mouse cursor over them. Alternatively, press "c", then "i", then the number corresponding to the one you wish to inspect.

If a particular Soul is bloating your inventory and drowning out access to more desirable spells, it can be removed through sacrificing them at a Relay, using a special "Forget" power from another soul, tossing them into the void after your character dies, or using them to power a Harmonic Modulator.
