## Rip in Reality - Creation Over Destruction

The Rip in Reality possesses the strange thermodynamic property of inversing entropy.

After a few days of (extremely rapid) evolution, its newly intelligent denizens (created completely naturally out of spontaneous generation - complex, living beings are naturally favoured by negentropy!) lived as gods, reshaping the world to their every whim. The shapes of these beings were often not very well suited to fine, dextrous engineering, but why did that matter? After all, if you left a rock on a counter, and thought really hard about it like a child on Christmas' Eve, it could very well turn into a quantum computer the next day! Capabilities of self-confidence, sharp wit and knowledge became sought after, as the Edge seemed like a lucid dream waiting for a potent wielder to pass through, commanding what should be created and in what shapes by sheer thought. Only the extent to which one believed they were powerful limited one's power. Pride was strength, and doubt, weakness.

Naturally, such a principle is not exactly conductive to harmonious communities. The first to develop high levels of intelligence understood the Edge's rules quicker than most, and immediately realized that order could never be established in a world where every random denizen can conjure up weapons of mass destruction against someone who had looked at them the wrong way. They *had to promote humility and self-doubt, while keeping the secret of glorious pride for themselves*.

Zaint, First of the Saints, stepped in as a leading figure promoting apathy, indifference and the reconsideration of needs and wants. (He wanted to name himself something nice starting with the letter Z, but stopped out of laziness after writing the first character, to send the message that one's name was so worthless writing it out was an unacceptable act of pride). Through his guidance, excesses of opulence decayed to modesty, and *complexity* itself became a monitored unit of value. This messiah initially proselytized out of self-interest and the desire to hide infinite power away from the masses, but as he lied and lied and lied, he eventually began believing his own words - after all, why was divine power so important anyways? Wouldn't it be much simpler to stop and smell the flowers? His soul got so imprinted with his mantras that in the end, this once dastardly figure got reduced to a drooling, immobile creature too lazy to ever accomplish anything.

He only became even greater of a symbol following this transformation, and the denizens of the Edge united under a common religion - the worship of *value* itself, the very nature of an object, concept or even idea to be *complex*. To craft a contraption, no matter how useless, as long as it was complex, was ritual, and to attempt the destruction of complex things was blashphemy. Not that the latter was easy - the Edge's natural force always opposed itself against murder, vandalism, deconstruction and gluttony, and its denizens saw this as a sign of the truth of Zaint's teachings, not knowing anyone of them could ascend to godhood with a stray thought away from their religion.

This faith divided society into six castes:

* The Saintly, who dictated what was valuable, and what was not, through their profound understanding of complexity.

* The Ordered, who protected valuable and complex things from destruction.

* The Artistic, who were directly responsible for the production of value.

* The Unhinged, who believed there was *something* more to the world than just modesty, but still provided some value through their complex revolutionary plotting, as well as the laughter directed towards the most foolish of them all.

* The Feral, who took Zaint's teachings way too seriously and regressed into an animalistic state, starved of ego. Their bodies bear important resources that can be used to produce complexity, but they refuse to share it.

* The Vile, who were mostly merchants, trading around value without contributing it directly. They are still necessary for the exchange of goods leading to the production of complexity, so their existence was not considered a negative, despite their name.

## Faith's End - The Imminent Cataclysm

Society marched on for a few weeks, with entire cities being created out of thin air by swarms of architects conjuring their blueprints into existence, and populated by millions in the span of literal hours by citizens who were once lifeless pebbles. Each time a simple child would conjure up some sweet candy with a thought, they would be unknowingly tapping into a force that would have been just as happy giving them a hydrogen bomb.

Alas, the candles that burn brightest burn for the shortest of times. As every possible piece of matter of the Rip in Reality never ceased to self-complexify, cities grew out to engulf one another, with streamlined passages and roads twisted and reshaped into nightmarishly complex mazes. Every urban space eventually joined into a single mass of concrete and nonsensical halls, the concrete itself now beginning to exhibit primordial patterns of sentience channeled through the vibrations that the denizens above produce while going about their lives.

Becoming worried about the ever-growing steel, stone and flesh starting to engulf the universe, Sugcha, Vilest of the Saints, studied intently the Unhinged caste's ramblings with the forbidden knowledge reserved to the Saints, and re-discovered a once-forgotten truth - that reality can be altered by thought and ego. Playing god would have been amusing a few weeks ago, but with the prospect of every further complexification hastening the demise of the world (an "overheating life-death of the universe"), perhaps a different course of action was in order...

Suddenly struck with the fantasy of cheating the end of the world, Sugcha manifested into existence a vast security network of sealed doors preventing transit between individual chambers of the world-city for unauthorized creatures, and forced a mantra of worthlessness upon every single one through the enslavement of all beings with a vast Ordered military force. With creation brought to a halt, surely the world as they knew it could live on a little longer...

The truth got out. Sugcha had not been the only one to peer behind the curtains of reality, and a few representatives of the six Castes began harnessing the Rip's properties for themselves, governing over their subjects like god-kings, also keeping the source of their power hidden. The over-complexification of the world could not be stopped. Sugcha named the world-complex Faith's End, after the era that was now coming to its conclusion.

As a plan B, Sugcha created a maximum security cell - the World Seed - in Faith's End, and engineered within a creature known as Terminal, the Reality Anchor. Explicitely designed to be able to contain souls other than its own, the "Vessel" would be tasked with the accumulation of a sufficient quantity of ego to gain the ability to conjure forth an entire, fresh new world from scratch - an extremely complex action - and fuel Sugcha's fantasy of sheltering herself from the cataclysm until the world would hopefully restart, fresh with untapped potential. As her final act, she overloaded the World Seed's conductor wires with immense electrical energy, and transcended the natural order of life, becoming the first creature to ever die. After she allowed her soul to be devoured, she became the Vessel's only passenger, while the Reality Anchor waited for the day it would be released from its cell to begin its quest.

Terminal was designed to forever keep its eyes closed and only sense the world in psychic glyphs, as a way to prevent it for feeling any emotion while completing its grim harvest. This censorship would later prove useful against the Harmony...

## Glamorous Toxin - An Escape From It All

After Saint Sugcha perished, Rose was appointed as the new leader of the Saints, chosen due to his uncanny ability to have every possible little thing go his way. Some rumoured him to be a god... Given the power to command a dying world that would soon draw its last breath, most souls would have been unable to do much except sulk and wait for oblivion to come.

The Last of the Saints was, surprisingly, very calm about the imminent doom of reality. Impassionated by fashion and glamour, he could not care less about the destruction of centuries of technological and artistic progress, if he could still grin and twirl before golden mirrors. To share this useful mindset, his first motion as Saint was the production of a terribly efficient psychedelic drug - Glamorous Toxin, or Saint's Breath, as some named it - that would let distraught souls help wait out the last of their days. In fact, the effect of this substance relied on taking a page from the primordial times in the Rip, and to *irreversibly alter the psyche of its users into a copy of Rose's*, so they would cease feeling dread and instead dance in glittery robes in ballrooms with ego and power Rose was confident his clones would not abuse.

But unrest still prowled among the six Castes. Sugcha's disappearance started to be researched, and Terminal's existence eventually became known. Many began cultivating a shred of hope following this reveal, realizing that they may be able to board a metaphorical seat aboard the Vessel by dying to it on its pilgrimage, and be granted a second chance at life in what came to be known as the Next World.

Rose did not care about these rumours. Surrounded by luxury, opulence and endless clones of himself, his narcissism rose to such high heights that his soul began to *split*. As the Last Saint repeatedly overdosed on his own drug, which only reinforced his own identity further, billowy vapour seeped out of his dreams, and formed an independent, ethereal creature animated by the *raw essence of pride itself*.

## Serene Spire - A Parasitic Infestation

This creature named herself Fluffy, from the softness of the white, billowy clouds that composed her body, and began prowling the halls of Faith's End, forcefully inserting herself in the lungs of the unwary, and converting the every thought of her hosts to synchronize with hers, until their bodies dissolved into elegant, pure white smoke in all points alike to the parasite. Enforcing Rose's assimilationist doctrine at an efficiency the Last Saint could only dream of, what came to be known as the Harmony began growing like cancer, converting all souls it could enthrall with its immaterial vapours.

As the incarnation of *ego* itself, this being was *terrifyingly* powerful. The Collectivits' sapience was derived solely from micro-depressurizations between their vapoury body and the outside air, and this function allowed any given Harmony member to reach *infinite* complexity within a given unit of space. No wonder their spread was so favoured.

The Harmony named itself the Serene Collective, due to this hivemind seeming incapable of ever feeling anger or sadness, and their presence was known way before their arrival in a given location: Feral Souls singing in discernible words, or the distant chiming of melodious bells. The mere realization that the Collective exists was enough to be infected.

Meanwhile, the Harmony grew unfathomably organized and intelligent. Its now many members skewered the Faith's End complex with the Serene Spire, an impossibly tall, but immaterial tower formed only of air currents pushing its occupants across platforms and branches of this new architectural monstrosity. Within, all those who called themselves Fluffy sought after a goal that their original maker could not have cared less about - the assimilation of all and achievement of a pure Harmonic reality at the maximum possible level of complexity - or, should that fail, the extension of the Harmonic dominion into the Next World created by Terminal.

The Spire grew taller and taller, extending their dominion.

Rose danced and danced, his grin growing increasingly insane as his veins pulsed with freshly injected toxin.

The Castes of the Old World cowered in their dwellings, praying for salvation.

And Terminal stepped out of its cell at last, bearing that salvation.

The Old World was ending at last. It was time.

## World Seed - Beyond The Veil

The entirety of reality that has just been described takes place inside Terminal's psyche - not the one you are controlling in the game, but rather, the one in the realm above. Higher-Terminal is thus sleeping soundly in his nice little cage in all points similar to the player's own, simulating the entire history of the Old World that Player-Terminal has been put through through his immense psychic capacity. When Higher-Terminal wakes up after a good night's sleep, his pocket dimension begins to unravel, causing the cataclysm at which point the game's events take place. Only a few souls are capable of persisting through Higher-Terminal's subconscious while he is awake - that is the eye of the Reality Vortex - and crafting the "Next World" - that is actually just Higher-Terminal's next night of sleep. But Higher-Terminal does not have infinite nights. Eventually, his world will end as well, as Higher-Higher-Terminal begins waking up. You, yourself, as Lower-Terminal, was tormenting an infinity of Lower-Lower-...-Terminals in the nights that preceded the cataclysm and the game's events, while you were waiting in your cell for your world to end.

In the game, when you lose a run and Fluffy takes over everything, you are simply invited to retry as Higher-Terminal, but with the Harmonic infection spreading one layer upwards every time as Higher-Terminal wakes with a strange dream of impossibly tall aether-spires and prideful puffs of smoke.

And so on, in a chain of infinity slimy purple critters with infinite pocket dimensions. You might be playing as any single one of them in any given run, in fact.

Fluffy only cares about constant expansion, and will never stop climbing up the chain. But, there are infinite Terminals, and her quest is neverending. The one time where a world is created without her, she will pour out of Rose's trance like in her origins, which will be the player's chance to rush the Roseic Circus and nip the infection in the bud.

What happens then?

With Fluffy absent, either the world gets engulfed by steel and concrete, or a Next World is created, repeating the cycle endlessly.

Or perhaps Terminal could ascend on his own, entering a null space devoid of souls to populate it, spreading an annihilating vacuum to break the cycle across all Terminals?

Does this fate appear terrible? Would it be better to end it all in one final blaze of glory ending not just reality, but rather the infinite realities contained within other realities?

Or is the Rip's story, no matter how deranged, worth living infinity times over?

# Extras

## Extra fun facts about the Rip in Reality

* Erosion is replaced by accretion. Left unchecked, rocks left out in the open become bigger and bigger as time passes, and in constantly more complex shapes, until entire factories producing completely useless, but incomprehensible gizmos are running without a single soul watching over them. Denizens of the Old World used to keep a grain of gravel in their burrows as calendars, and replaced it every month after it had grown the size of a pebble!

* Death - Aging causes not one to become weaker, but rather more complex. Extremely old creatures become chimeric masses of organs and limbs that cannot even move. One dies in the Rip by becoming unable to act due to one's body being bloated with unnecessary features.

* Predation and Reproduction - It is thermodynamically impossible to kill any living being in the Rip. Many simple organisms enjoy asexual reproduction, dividing themselves endlessly with zero need for resources whatsoever. Others prefer the thrill of the chase, and will actively seek out other beings to assimilate to their species. Creation is encouraged, destruction is forbidden, but nobody said anything about transmutation...

* Nutrition - No creature needs to eat for sustenance - swallowing anything will usually eventually have it be spit out as a newborn of the devourer's species. Instead, as time passes, organisms produce nutrients on their own that must eventually be discharged through some kind of disposal mechanism. Quills, self-division, leaving one's tail behind, and skin shedding are all common occurrences among the denizens of the Rip.

* Universal Sapience - After a few dozens of years of existence in the Rip, every creature develops some kind of consciousness, plants included! They can't do much about it. On rarer occasions, this can also happen to inorganic matter. Every boulder could very well be an ancient artificial intelligence, cursed to be only occupied by its own mind in a void without perception or senses. 

* Ruins - In its early ages, the Rip was littered with a variety of derelict industrial buildings - expect to find aqueducts, reservoirs, factories, reactors and processing plants. These were not built by anyone - in fact, they were the product of a single pebble, which, throughout the years, accumulated matter in an increasingly complex shape! Inside the guts of these buildings, pipes connect to concrete walls, boilers are built upside down and silos have holes in them. The Rip's influence may be impressive in scale, but certainly not in the engineering department.

* End of the World - It is said that when all will be consumed by the ever-growing flesh, rock and metal, the Rip's properties will reverse, eroding itself until it returns to the barren state it once was at the very beginning. It would have been interesting to ask the savant who came up with this theory what would happen afterwards, but sadly, they became a mass of sapient insects after an unfortunate accident.

* Rebirth - When a thinking individual disappears in the Rip, often through conversion or excessive aging, they tend to eventually come back in some way, for the Rip does not favor permanent destruction. Many sometimes wonder how many times they've been reborn. Nightmares of being turned into or eaten by terrifying creatures sometimes haunt one's nights. One may hope these aren't visions of their past lives - what terrible moments these must have been!
