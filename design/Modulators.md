# Harmonic Modulators

As the player progresses towards the Reality Vortex, they are likely to accumulate an impressive collection of Souls, but especially a lot of Common Souls from one of the six spiritual castes (Vile, Feral, Unhinged, Artistic, Ordered, Saintly). These are fine enough on their own in the earlier, easier levels, but will quickly bloat your inventory and limit access to their more powerful Legendary counterparts when they become overly proeminent.

Of course, one may sacrifice some of these Common souls in the Harmonic Relays, or leave them to be consumed by the void after meeting an unfortunate end, but these methods will only delay the inevitable: a mind filled with chattering souls with zero regard for ensuring your success. We need big solutions to this big problem, and the Harmony has what you need.

## Gaseous Cybernetics

As you ascend the **Serene Spire**, one of the 4 main branches, you may eventually come across a Harmonic Tinker, who will be more than happy to sell you some of the technology the Serene Collective prides itself on. After breathing in some neuron-rewiring fumes from a shattered Modulator Orb, a new Harmonic Modulator will be installed within your psyche, allowing one to simulate some of the thought patterns that make the Collectivists so efficient in all they do. Or, they can give you rocket thrusters. Whichever sounds cooler to the Tinker at the time.

Using these is not free - every single time their effect takes place, you will lose a predetermined amount of Common souls. However, this cost is simultaneously a boon, as it lets you clean up some of these pesky hitchhikers drowning all the cool screen-wiping lasers underneath their puny dashes and heals.

What happens to the Common souls being consumed? They are teletransported into the Spire for instant harmonization, of course. But, shh, talking about that part is against the Terms of Service.

Understand that this is all just another ploy from the Harmony to extend their dominion over your identity. The less Common Souls you have, the quieter their chatter becomes, and the louder the Harmonic Song grows. A careful user will turn off their Modulators before excess, and only burn up their inventory if they require a burst of power.

Additionally, having a modulator active will grant a special power to all Serene souls. Yet another incentive to annihilate your individuality in your quest for supreme power.
