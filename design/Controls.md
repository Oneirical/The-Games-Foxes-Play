Unlike archaic or pseudo-archaic roguelikes, I tried to make it so 7 extra arms, 3 tentacles and a few robotic cybernetics are not required to play the game.

## Gameplay

**w**/**a**/**s**/**d** - Move/attack/interact in the 4 cardinal directions. There is no diagonal movement or waiting in TGFP - it is part of the design.

**q** - Draw souls from your storage into your hotbar. It's kind of like reloading a gun with multicoloured bullets. It stands for "Quiver".

**1-9** - Invoke souls from your hotbar. It's kind of like firing said gun. You can also click on them.

**f** - Cycle through Harmonic Modulators. It's kind of like adding modifiers on the gun. It stands for "Fluffy". In Harmonic Relay rooms, it will also reroll non-Serene cages.

## Information

**c** - Enter examine mode, to read tile descriptions and creature abilities. It stands for "Cursor". Use the mouse to move the cursor.

**i** - Also available by leftclicking in examine mode. Enter Soul View mode, to read the effects of souls in your hotbar, or owned by a creature. Only usable in examine mode. It stands for "Inspect".
