* Revolves around impressive combos, numerous hordes of enemies and agile motion.

Faith's End is all-encompassing, and spans the entire world. The player always begins in Faith's End. The Roseic Circus *is* Faith's End, but seen through the lens of Glamorous toxin, a potent hallucinogen. The Serene Spire can be accessed through various access points around Faith's End.

Each time the player dies, they are warped to a random location in Faith's End.

* **Faith's End** - A claustrophobic complex, composed of small cubic rooms and tight hallways with randomly generated layouts. Playstyle here is all about strategic steps and attacks, not getting cornered, and managing Resolve -- the amount of Souls you can summon in each room. You can summon souls beyond your Resolve counter, but that costs Ipseity. Every 5 rooms, a Harmonic Relay grants you the opportunity to trade 10 Common Souls for 4 Legendary Souls, but messing up the minigame may generate Serene Souls instead. At the end of Faith's End awaits the boss Epsilon, a robotic snake who executes movements based on code blocks placed on the battlefield.

* **Roseic Circus** - A wacky arena with a few possible layouts, watched over by the playful and mischievious Rose, the last Saint to govern the Old World. This branch flips around typical roguelike gameplay, as the game's creatures are so hateful of Rose's tyranny that they will gladly side with you just this once to take him down, rendering this area a "boss rush" of sorts with a focus on ally battling. Gather up your monster summoning powers, and test your cunning against the Last Saint's many tricks and illusions! Watch out for the Glamorous Toxin, with confusing mind-warping properties.

* **Serene Spire** - The vertical homebase of the Serene Collective, populated only by the numerous Harmonizers. Gravity takes effect here, making upwards movement only possible while standing on a ladder, and constantly threatening the player with a long fall to the bottom. The Serene Collectivists dislike intruders, can fly, and will actively use their many hypermobile, low damage spells to try to push you off, or zone you away from the ladders so they may win by attrition. After climbing 5 floors, a more peaceful Serene Harmonizer will offer you the purchase of a Harmonic Modulator, which should help the player with the excess Common souls that may be bloating their inventory. At the summit of the Spire, you may challenge Fluffy, the gestalt consciousness of the hivemind, and try to fend off the massive horde while chasing after elusive musicians powering the Harmonic Song.

Prototype/primordial ideas

* **Ascension Vortex** - The endgame, a synthesis of all that you have traversed so far. As the merging of all that remains of the Old World, prepare to battle enemies from all 4 branches, and to suffer through the terrifying synergies they can craft in this unusual partnership of the Roseic citizens, the Serene Collectivists, the Faith's End specimens, and the beasts from the Edge of Reality. Brave the roaring winds at the end of the world, and find your way to the Vortex's Eye, where the final showdown awaits.

* **Vortex's Eye** - The ultimate confrontation between you, and the three other bosses that you did not defeat on your run. Only one contender shall survive this 1v1v1v1, and get to choose how to shape the Next World.

* **Edge of Reality** - A more traditional area in terms of classical roguelike design, with a winding cave-like format and limited field of view. Explored territory outside the player's sight will occasionally warp into other shapes, constantly changing the landscape. Killing enough enemies will summon a special prefab vault, presenting a sizable challenge, and progressing the global room count by 1 should it be beaten. Watch out for the Harmonic Hunters prowling about for fresh converts. After one has braved the wilderness long enough, the way to the Heart of Reality will open, where the legendary hunter Ronin may be found. Watch out for his acrobatic moves, and pay attention to the directions in which he dashes, for each wall causes a different effect when struck.
