The fascination is getting to me. My ideas are getting weirder by the day. This might be the week in which I put the most hours into my game since its very inception. I don't even want to play video games anymore, I just want to make *make* **make**.



# ALL IS SOUL

I am currently in the process of **removing tiles from my game**. That's right, every wall, feature and doorway is being turned into a creature that *believes* it is an inanimate object. Their Souls, devoid of any reaction to the passage of time, only have simple Axioms such as "You are untargetable.".

(Floor tiles will remain as the only tile type).

I expect lots of horrible bugs to surface from this rework, but for now, it has allowed me to create this hilarious ["reverse black hole" giga-spell](), which instantly makes any pain endured in development worth it. The matching Soul goes roughly like this: *"When the spell hotkey is pressed, target all adjacent tiles to the caster, expand, expand, expand, [...], exclude the caster's tile, warp every targeted creature as far away from the caster as possible."*

There has been previous times where I journeyed into fundamental reworks like this only to get disappointed and undo everything. This time, I think this is genuinely a great idea:

* If I am not wrong, not having to draw tiles and just plopping creatures on a black background will improve performance considerably on my potato laptop.
* If I am not wrong, only having to save the position, health and Soul value of creatures and not tiles will do wonders for my soon-to-be save & load system.
* Lore-wise and flavour-wise, it's just perfect.

I'll be building a starter dungeon of sorts soon where every single interaction revolves around my Soul system. If everything goes according to plan, it will have cool powers like enemy ability copying and body swapping (both of which are trivial due to the Soul system - the creature which currently is the "player" is only determined by which entity is holding the legendary Reality Anchor...) 

Perhaps... a new demo before the end of the year is possible? That will depend on what Real Lifeâ„¢ has in store for me...
