I tried to pull off some awesome stunt involving a whole portal network leading to different pocket dimensions, but quickly entered rage mode as a mega-ton of strange glitches and conflicts with old code from 1 year ago started to rain down on me. And JavaScript's undefined-null-NaN's funhouse was not helping. After doing my best to dismiss the ever-invasive thoughts of "wipe the entire thing and restart with a new programming language", I came to the following conclusion:

*Another Great Purge is needed*.

I have been ruthlessly wiping out codeblock after codeblock of ancient work from back when I didn't even know how to use Git. It feels a little sad to see all those hours going down the drain, but the knowledge I acquired getting here will not be taken away from me.

Development must halt for now as I refactor everything and purge the weak. It is hard to understate how fantastic it feels to go from [this crime against computing](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504088568084561930/1154849776148422666/Capture_decran_le_2023-09-22_a_14.40.13.png) to [this work of art](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504088568084561930/1154849776400076930/Capture_decran_le_2023-09-22_a_14.40.27.png).

Still, there were some minor gameplay tweaks. For example, to encourage more interesting interactions "summoning"-type Axioms have been changed to clone existing creatures instead. This means that just running around and spamming the same old goon (boring) is no longer possible. Instead, one must use the force of the enemy against itself, like a martial artist would.
