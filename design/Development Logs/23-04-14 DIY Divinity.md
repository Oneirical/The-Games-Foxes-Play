First, I had a problem with the map generation system generally making unfun structures. Therefore, I made it so the player can build their own dungeon networks, since they probably know better than I do what is fun for them. When in doubt, outsource the labour.

Now, I am doing the same for spells.

# DIY Divinity

I am retiring the concept of multiple pre-defined spells from my game - the Ã  la DCSS kind with a massive list to choose from. I have all this lore about souls being malleable and adaptative, and then I forcefeed the player with hardcoded, immutable effects. No can do.

Instead, I have enabled the player to craft their own tools of destruction (and occasionally, creation)!
