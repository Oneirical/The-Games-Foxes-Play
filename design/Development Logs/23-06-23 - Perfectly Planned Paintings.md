*"As the Vile found out, the simplest way to exclude oneself from a rule was to be the one to write it. All it took was a couple of souls who loved the feeling of subservience, and the gears of oppression had already started to turn."*

- flavour text of Law Stands Above Law, Vile Mutator (forces spell effects to ignore the caster even if they are in the blast zone)

# Perfectly Planned Paintings

The Soul Cage room, where TGFP's core crafting mechanic takes stage, has regained all of its auxiliary UI panels! The player may view all kinds of craftable Praxes in a sidebar catalogue, consult the current state of the Axiom being crafted, and pinpoint the location of all placed patterns. [Demonstration!]().

After an Axiom has been crafted, it may be equipped in this work-in-progress but overhauled [inventory screen](). On the sidebar, all Praxes inside each Axiom are listed, and can be described on a simple mouseover.

The Soul Cage room has also received this curious panel in the bottom left with a lot of numbers - it is a primitive implementation of my new Influence mechanic, which should be a dynamic way to scale both player power and encounter difficulty together.
