Something very ironic about my ["research web"]() is how much it helps me develop my game. Every time I am wondering what to work on next, I just play my game filling it out until I hit a void of incomplete content preventing me from progressing in it. Then, I fill in the gap with Contentâ„¢ and proceed to the next node. It really makes me feel like I am learning the arts of soul-weaving alongside my protagonist.
