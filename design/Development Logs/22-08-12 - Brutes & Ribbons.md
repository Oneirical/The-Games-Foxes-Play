More quality of life and UI features this week! Mouse support for cursor examination is now fully implemented. You can click to swap between viewing the "soul" (loot) of enemies, and their description/abilities, and all weird bugs that led to being able to let the cursor escape the screen have been fixed.

There are also two new enemies: 

* **Rosebound Brutes** are very slow, but inflict very high melee damage. They are easy to handle, as you can simply stab them on each turn they skip thanks to their slowness to not take any damage. However, their slowness comes from the fact that their movements are entangled by...

* **Roseic Bioembalmers**, which always appear as the leaders of a pack of Brutes. These pests, on the other hand, are extremely fast and will constantly harass you, dealing zero damage but inflicting one point of Glamorous Toxin on every hit (Toxin is a hallucinogen that will kill you after 10 points have been accumulated). However, if you kill them, all Brutes under their command will be unentangled, and furious at having been kept captive for so long, tripling their once lethargic speed.

These are supposed to be late-game enemies, that you should be able to deal with after getting sufficient AOE damage, or summons to defend you. However, to keep the player on their toes, they will rarely spawn in early levels in much more thinned-out numbers. I might end up removing them from early levels if they are too strong!

New music has also been added to the game - two songs named Candles and Trinkets. I'll show the first one in this post [here](https://sndup.net/r3vz/). It's a calm tune with a repeating motif that climaxes into a slightly dissonant end, inciting the player to realize their rest is only temporary.
