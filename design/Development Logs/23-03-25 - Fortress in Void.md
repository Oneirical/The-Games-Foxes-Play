Ah, long time no see.

Random circumstances led to an opportunity to show my game to a group of people in the legendary dimension spoken in whispers among developer enclaves: the Demiplane of Real Life.

I initially didn't want to hog the spotlight for too long, but I was pleasantly surprised when I realized the audience was genuinely interested and asking many questions. They were a bit overwhelmed by all the interconnecting mechanisms (especially considering they had no experience with traditional roguelikes) but otherwise, it was a resounding success.

Now, as for progress proper, I [implemented](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504088568084561930/1089395888360796201/Capture_decran_le_2023-03-25_a_23.49.55.png) prefabricated dungeons on the map. Now, I can build my own little fortresses to my heart's content!

Attentive observers may notice the new grid display on the map. This is actually not intentional. This "bug" appeared out of nowhere and I have no idea why it displays like this, but honestly, I find it hard to complain. It looks kind of good. You know things are working out when the universal entropy of the universe is helping you make your game.

I'm getting a lot of cold feet every time I try to think of something new. A lot of times, I will think of something, cross it off, go back to the drawing board... I implemented and removed 3 features in a row now and I don't want to waste any more time.

Maybe that fabled "design document" wasn't a joke after all.
