Well well well well well. Look at me coming back to the JavaScript libraries with my tail between my legs, moments after I said I was done. I tried to resume feature development normally, but after entering the crafting room and seeing my FPS become a slideshow presentation, I realized that my game code has reached its limit. It is bloated by gore and unholy practices from back when I was literally using my own game as motivation to learn how to code. I see now why Kyzrati said "don't make your dream roguelike right away unless you like starting over".

Well I do kind of like starting over. It's refreshing to grab a big axe and butcher up the unworthy who think parasiting my 256MB of VRAM with their 1500+ drawSprite() calls every 15 milliseconds is funny.
