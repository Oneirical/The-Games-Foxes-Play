Long time no see! This post will get buried, but I want to indicate that I have not been devoured by some terrifying eldritch entity and am, in fact, still alive. I haven't stopped. Updates and bugfixes have been trickling down, at a slow yet steady pace over the last few weeks.

I am currently doing a [major UI rework](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504088568084561930/1152672064394756157/Capture_decran_le_2023-09-16_a_14.26.47.png). Each entity can now be individually inspected, revealing the very programming that makes them tick. There's so many keywords in these descriptions - I think the most gloriously horrible one is "When an Axiom of this Axiom's Axiom-type Data is Pulsed, Pulse this Axiom, keeping the same Targets."

I'll obviously add some "Slay the Spire"-style vignettes to describe what each keyword means (what in an Axiom?). But a part of me is kind of amused by how arcane all of these sound. Considering that this "programming" is themed as being "forbidden knowledge" and that the player would be using "premade" Souls with much clearer, more traditional descriptions early on, it might be interesting to keep this kind of wording just as a puzzle of sorts.

A new chapter in my life has began, and it seems every single day has its own load of disturbances. I already have made the choice to quit DCSS seriously for now to free up more time, but the degree of freedom keep getting narrower and narrower. I believe a strict schedule will be necessary, with tighter regulation especially on that pesky little screen in my pocket that keeps hypnotizing me when I look at it for too long.
