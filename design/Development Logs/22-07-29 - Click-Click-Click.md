**The Games Foxes Play**

I’m away from home right now so I cannot do as much of an in-depth writeup as I’d like, but I want to give a huge thanks to u/Spellsweaver for doing a playtest trade with me. He has outlined a lot of UI issues that I have been working on fixing this week.

For example, all abilities now show precise damage numbers for clarity. Health points are divided in pips instead of being a straight line. [You can now mouse over Souls to get their descriptions at any time](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/504088568084561930/1002764571737595934/IMG_2122.png), and click to cast them. Additionally, the inspect mode cursor [now follows your mouse](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/504088568084561930/1002764571959885894/IMG_2123.png).

The screenshots don’t show the true glory of mouse support, but it’s all I have for now. The build isn’t uploaded on the itch.io playable version yet, but I will do so tomorrow. [GitHub](https://github.com/Oneirical/The-Games-Foxes-Play) is updated, though.

It would be nice to have full mouse support in my game - getting code to work to get the mouse position when it’s pertinent was the hard part, and now I can play around a lot of things that should really streamline play instead of having users roll their heads on the keyboard.

I also decided to remove the Rendfly enemies from my game. They were an annoying 0 damage monster that was extremely fast and would delay the death of other monsters by injecting them with tonics. Fun design in theory, but immensely annoying in practice and also the source of a terrarium-full of bugs. I liked the idea of a support-type creature, so they will come back eventually with a reworked design that’s not about chasing them all over the room while getting stabbed by roid-rage invincible dudes.
