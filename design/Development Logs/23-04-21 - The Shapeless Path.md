Oh, as I was tinkering around with some potentially fun spell combinations, here is a particularly hilarious one I stumbled upon:

* The EGO Form targets yourself.
* The GYVJI Function causes all targets to be brutally punched backwards, until they collide with an object, at which point they take massive damage and emit a damaging shockwave.
* The SHIELD Function causes all targets to gain temporary invincibility.

This means:

* EGO-SHIELD: You become temporarily invincible. Neat but boring.
* EGO-GYVJI: You launch yourself into a wall and perish pathetically.
* EGO-SHIELD-GYVJI: You BLAST OUT like a ROCKET LAUNCHER and EXTERMINATE every bystander with the shockwave, and leave COMPLETELY UNHARMED.
