First, I welcome yet another JavaScript library to my pile of "things that would have taken weeks to do myself" - Pixi Viewpoint. Following an excruciating implementation process, it has allowed me to transform my zoom animation code (which used to be roughly the coding equivalent to rotting roadkill on an unpaved road after a nuclear apocalypse) into something *much*, [much more presentable](), and with a seamlessness I find quite charming.
