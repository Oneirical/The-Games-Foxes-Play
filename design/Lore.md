# Lore

## I'm not really updating this document anymore for now - why write lore here when I can write it directly for my game? Recommended only if you like reading random archives that may or may not get invalidated later.

Spoilers.

## Edge of Reality - Creation Over Destruction

The Edge of Reality possesses the strange thermodynamic property of inversing entropy.

* Erosion is replaced by accretion. Left unchecked, rocks left out in the open become bigger and bigger as time passes, and in constantly more complex shapes, until entire factories producing completely useless, but incomprehensible gizmos are running without a single soul watching over them. Denizens of the Old World used to keep a grain of gravel in their burrows as calendars, and replaced it every month after it had grown the size of a pebble!

* Death - Aging causes not one to become weaker, but rather more complex. Extremely old creatures become chimeric masses of organs and limbs that cannot even move. One dies in the Edge by becoming unable to act due to one's body being bloated with unnecessary features.

* Predation and Reproduction - It is thermodynamically impossible to kill any living being in the Edge. Many simple organisms enjoy asexual reproduction, dividing themselves endlessly with zero need for resources whatsoever. Others prefer the thrill of the chase, and will actively seek out other beings to assimilate to their species. Creation is encouraged, destruction is forbidden, but nobody said anything about transformation!

* Nutrition - No creature needs to eat for sustenance - swallowing anything will usually eventually have it be spit out as a newborn of the devourer's species. Instead, as time passes, organisms produce nutrients on their own that must eventually be discharged through some kind of disposal mechanism. Quills, self-division, leaving one's tail behind, and skin shedding are all common occurrences among the animals of the Edge!

* Universal Sapience - After a few dozens of years of existence in the Edge, every creature develops some kind of consciousness, plants included! They can't do much about it. On rarer occasions, this can also happen to inorganic matter. Every boulder could very well be an ancient artificial intelligence, cursed to be only occupied by its own mind in a void without perception or senses. 

* Ruins - The Edge is littered with a variety of derelict industrial buildings - expect to find aqueducts, reservoirs, factories, reactors and processing plants. These were not built by anyone - in fact, they are the product of a single pebble, which, throughout the years, accumulated matter in an increasingly complex shape! Inside the guts of these buildings, pipes connect to concrete walls, boilers are built upside down and silos have holes in them. The Edge's influence may be impressive in scale, but certainly not in the engineering department.

* End of the World - It is said that when all will be consumed by the ever-growing flesh, rock and metal, the Rip's properties will reverse, eroding itself until it returns to the barren state it once was at the very beginning. It would have been interesting to ask the savant who came up with this theory what would happen afterwards, but sadly, they became a mass of unthinking insects after an unfortunate accident.

* Rebirth - When a thinking individual disappears in the Edge, often through conversion or excessive aging, they tend to eventually come back in some way, for the Edge does not favor permanent destruction. Many sometimes wonder how many times they've been reborn. Nightmares of being turned into or eaten by terrifying creatures sometimes haunt one's nights. One may hope these aren't visions of their past lives - what terrible moments these must have been!

## Faith's End - Where Civilization Began

Some sapient beasts of the Edge eventually grew tired of endless cycles of predation and rebirth, and chose to settle into one of the landscape's largest natural factories, labelled Faith's End - where the creatures of the world would abandon false belief in fate, and take control of their own destinies with technology.

Aided by the anti-entropic powers of the Edge, a culture began to form, divided in castes requiring the aid of one another, and governed over by a benevolent Saint. Zaint, first of the Saints, passed on values of modesty, remniscence of one's origins, and cooperation, aiding in the forging of the first centers of permanent residence, trade and labour.

Capabilities of self-confidence, sharp wit and knowledge became sought after, as the Edge seemed like a lucid dream waiting for a potent wielder to pass through, commanding what should be created and in what shapes by sheer thought. Even without opposable thumbs, craftsmanship, art and precision engineering could thus thrive. After all, if you leave a rock on a counter, and think really hard about it like a child on Christmas' Eve, it may very well turn into a computer the next day.

## Roseic Metropolis - The Decay Of All Things

## Serene Spire - A Parasitic Infestation

## Vortex's Eye - The Final Ascension

## The Cage - Beyond The Veil

The entirety of reality that has just been described does not actually exist. It is the dream of Terminal - not the one you are controlling in the game, but rather, the one in the realm above. Higher-Terminal is thus sleeping soundly in his nice little cage in all points similar to your own, simulating the entire history of the Old World that Lower-Terminal has been put through by sheer imagination. When Higher-Terminal wakes up, his pocket dimension begins to unravel, causing the cataclysm at which point the game's events take place. Only a few souls are capable of persisting through Higher-Terminal's subconscious while he is awake, and crafting the "Next World" - that is actually just Higher-Terminal's next night of sleep.

In the game, when you lose a run, you are simply invited to retry in a future night of Higher-Terminal. Perhaps not the one that immediately follows your failure, for a Next World imagined by Fluffy probably doesn't even have a Terminal in it. But, as Zaint declared, all things decay, even the Collectivist peace, and eventually, a Next World is created, in all points identical to the one you first failed in, allowing you to try again...

But Higher-Terminal does not have infinite nights. Eventually, his world will end as well, as Higher-Higher-Terminal begins waking up. You, yourself, as Lower-Terminal, was tormenting an infinity of Lower-Lower-...-Terminals in the nights that preceded the cataclysm and the game's events.

And so on, in a chain of infinity fuzzy purple critters with infinite pocket dimensions. You might be playing as any single one of them in any given run, in fact.

Does this fate appear terrible? Would there be a way to transmit a message upwards the chain that would improve the wellbeing of everyone involved?

I do not know, dear reader.
