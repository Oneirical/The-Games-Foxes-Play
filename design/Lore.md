## Edge of Reality - Creation Over Destruction

The Edge of Reality possessed the strange thermodynamic property of inversing entropy.

In the first Era of Divinity, its denizens (created completely naturally out of spontaneous generation - complex, living beings are naturally favoured by negentropy!) lived as gods, reshaping the world to their every whim. The shapes of these beings were often not very well suited to fine, dextrous engineering, but why did that matter? After all, if you left a rock on a counter, and thought really hard about it like a child on Christmas' Eve, it could very well turn into a quantum computer the next day! Capabilities of self-confidence, sharp wit and knowledge became sought after, as the Edge seemed like a lucid dream waiting for a potent wielder to pass through, commanding what should be created and in what shapes by sheer thought. 

They eventually realized that the universe's resources that allowed them to do this were *not* infinite.

Zaint, First of the Saints, stepped in as a leading figure promoting apathy, indifference and the reconsideration of needs and wants. (He wanted to name himself something nice starting with the letter Z, but stopped out of laziness after writing the first character). Through his guidance, excesses of opulence decayed to modesty, and *complexity* itself became a monitored unit of value. After all, to build intricate objects, concepts and even ideas was to push back against the exhaustion of the divinity common to all beings!

The importance of this fact divided society into six castes:

* The Saintly, who dictated what was valuable, and what was not, through their profound understanding of complexity.

* The Ordered, who protected valuable and complex things from destruction.

* The Artistic, who were directly responsible for the production of value.

* The Unhinged, who opposed this order, but still provided some value through their complex revolutionary plotting, as well as the laughter directed towards the most foolish of them all.

* The Feral, who were once highly intelligent creatures who depended on Negentropic energy to remain sapient. The new monastic order caused their decay into an animalistic state, starved of complexity. Their bodies bear important resources that can be used to produce complexity, but they refuse to share it.

* The Vile, who were mostly merchants, trading around value without contributing it directly. They are still necessary for the exchange of goods leading to the production of complexity, so their existence was not considered a negative, despite their name.

## Faith's End - The Imminent Cataclysm

Society marched on for centuries, slowly whittling away the world's reserves of complexity. Each time a simple child would conjure up some sweet candy with a thought, they would hasten the end of the world by a few milliseconds.

When doomsday became only a few decades away, Sugcha, the Penultimate Saint, was suddenly struck with the fantasy of cheating the end of the world, and delaying it through the enslavement of all beings with a vast Ordered military force.

In a burst of megalomania, she gathered up almost all of the Edge's remaining complexity, and conjured up the Negentropic Reactor in collaboration with multiple tinkers subservient to her will. This titanic, impossibly complex machine replicated for a few minutes the creative power of the Edge's first milliseconds of existence, transforming a single pebble into a nigh-infinite concrete bunker known as Faith's End. Flattening all architecture and landscape across the world, this horrid building became the residence of every living soul, each one enslaved to produce as much complexity as possible in a last stand against the collapse of reality. The Negentropic Reactor exploded right after the completion of this demented project, its many fragments still humming full of untapped, raw complexity.

Of course, it was completely hopeless, and Sugcha realized this after only a few days. As a plan B, she used one such fragment to create a maximum security cell in Faith's End, and engineer within a creature known as Terminal, the Reality Anchor. Explicitely designed to be able to contain souls other than its own, the "Vessel" would be tasked with voyaging to the center of the world - the eye of the storm of the imminent cataclysm - and fuelling Sugcha's fantasy of sheltering herself from the cataclysm until the world would hopefully restart, fresh with untapped Negentropic energy. Sugcha fed Terminal her Reactor fragment to remove its biological needs, and allowed herself to be slain by Terminal's claws. Thus she became the Vessel's only passenger, while the Reality Anchor waited for the day it would be released from its cell to begin its quest. Even in death, it would continue marching onwards to the Reality Vortex, as Negentropy powered its many reincarnations, preventing death for as long as it would still contain leftover complexity.

## Glamorous Toxin - An Escape From It All

After Saint Sugcha perished, Rose was appointed as the new leader of the world, chosen due to his impressively efficient production of complexity with his ribbon and fabric factory. Given the power to command a dying world that would soon draw its last breath, most souls would have been unable to do much except sulk and wait for oblivion to come.

The Last of the Saints was, surprisingly, very calm about the imminent doom of reality. Impassionated by fashion and glamour, he could not care less about the destruction of centuries of technological and artistic progress, if he could still grin and twirl before golden mirrors. To share this useful mindset, his first motion as Saint was the production of a terribly efficient psychedelic drug - Glamorous Toxin, or Saint's Breath, as some named it - that would let distraught souls help wait out the last of their days. In fact, the effect of this substance relied on taking a page from the Era of Divinity's habits, and to *irreversibly alter the psyche of its users into a copy of Rose's*, so they would cease feeling dread and instead dance in glittery robes in ballrooms.

But unrest still prowled among the six Castes. Sugcha's disappearance started to be researched, and Terminal's existence eventually became known. Many isolated themselves away from the Roseic dominion following this reveal, realizing that they may be able to board a metaphorical seat aboard the Vessel by dying to it on its pilgrimage, and be granted a second chance at life in what came to be known as the Next World.

Rose did not care about these rumours. Surrounded by luxury, opulence and endless clones of himself, his narcissism rose to such high heights that his soul began to *split*. As the Last Saint repeatedly overdosed on his own drug, which only reinforced his own identity further, billowy vapour seeped out of his dreams, and formed an independent, ethereal creature animated by the *raw essence of pride itself*.

## Serene Spire - A Parasitic Infestation

This creature named herself Fluffy, from the softness of the white, billow clouds that composed her body, and began prowling the halls of Faith's End, forcefully inserting herself in the lungs of the unwary, and converting the every thought of her hosts to synchronize with hers, until their bodies dissolved into elegant, pure white smoke in all points alike to the parasite. Enforcing Rose's assimilationist doctrine at an efficiency the Last Saint could only dream of, what came to be known as the Harmony began growing like cancer, converting all souls it could enthrall with its immaterial vapours.

The people noticed this phenomenon, of course. Horrified, they locked themselves as best they could in their dwellings across Faith's End, battling day and night to preserve the hold on their identity threatened by Harmonic and Roseic influences alike, waiting for the day Terminal would save them from their terror. They named the Harmony the Serene Collective, due to this hivemind seeming incapable of ever feeling anger or sadness, and learned the signs that foretold their arrival: Feral Souls singing in discernible words, or the distant chiming of melodious bells.

Meanwhile, the Harmony grew unfathomably organized and intelligent. Its now many members skewered the Faith's End complex with the Serene Spire, an impossibly tall, but immaterial tower formed only of air currents pushing its occupants across platforms and branches of this new architectural monstrosity. Within, all those who called themselves Fluffy sought after a goal that their original maker could not have cared less about - the extension of the Harmonic dominion into the Next World.

The Spire grew taller and taller, towards the eye of the Reality Vortex.

Rose danced and danced, his grin growing increasingly insane as his veins pulsed with freshly injected toxin.

The Castes of the Old World cowered in their dwellings, praying for salvation.

And Terminal stepped out of its cell at last, bearing that salvation.

The Old World was ending at last. It was time.

## World Seed - Beyond The Veil

The entirety of reality that has just been described takes place inside Terminal's psyche - not the one you are controlling in the game, but rather, the one in the realm above. Higher-Terminal is thus sleeping soundly in his nice little cage in all points similar to the player's own, simulating the entire history of the Old World that Player-Terminal has been put through through his immense psychic capacity. When Higher-Terminal wakes up after a good night's sleep, his pocket dimension begins to unravel, causing the cataclysm at which point the game's events take place. Only a few souls are capable of persisting through Higher-Terminal's subconscious while he is awake - that is the eye of the Reality Vortex - and crafting the "Next World" - that is actually just Higher-Terminal's next night of sleep.

In the game, when you lose a run, you are simply invited to retry in a future night of Higher-Terminal. Perhaps not the one that immediately follows your failure, for a Next World imagined by Fluffy probably doesn't even have a Terminal in it. But, as Zaint declared, all things decay, even the Collectivist peace, and eventually, a Next World is created, in all points identical to the one you first failed in, allowing you to try again...

But Higher-Terminal does not have infinite nights. Eventually, his world will end as well, as Higher-Higher-Terminal begins waking up. You, yourself, as Lower-Terminal, was tormenting an infinity of Lower-Lower-...-Terminals in the nights that preceded the cataclysm and the game's events, while you were waiting in your cell for your world to end.

And so on, in a chain of infinity slimy purple critters with infinite pocket dimensions. You might be playing as any single one of them in any given run, in fact.

Does this fate appear terrible? Would it be better to end it all in one final blaze of glory ending not just reality, but rather the infinite realities contained within other realities?

Or is the Edge's story, no matter how deranged, worth living infinity times over?

# Extras

## Extra fun facts about the Era of Divinity

* Erosion is replaced by accretion. Left unchecked, rocks left out in the open become bigger and bigger as time passes, and in constantly more complex shapes, until entire factories producing completely useless, but incomprehensible gizmos are running without a single soul watching over them. Denizens of the Old World used to keep a grain of gravel in their burrows as calendars, and replaced it every month after it had grown the size of a pebble!

* Death - Aging causes not one to become weaker, but rather more complex. Extremely old creatures become chimeric masses of organs and limbs that cannot even move. One dies in the Edge by becoming unable to act due to one's body being bloated with unnecessary features.

* Predation and Reproduction - It is thermodynamically impossible to kill any living being in the Edge. Many simple organisms enjoy asexual reproduction, dividing themselves endlessly with zero need for resources whatsoever. Others prefer the thrill of the chase, and will actively seek out other beings to assimilate to their species. Creation is encouraged, destruction is forbidden, but nobody said anything about transformation!

* Nutrition - No creature needs to eat for sustenance - swallowing anything will usually eventually have it be spit out as a newborn of the devourer's species. Instead, as time passes, organisms produce nutrients on their own that must eventually be discharged through some kind of disposal mechanism. Quills, self-division, leaving one's tail behind, and skin shedding are all common occurrences among the animals of the Edge!

* Universal Sapience - After a few dozens of years of existence in the Edge, every creature develops some kind of consciousness, plants included! They can't do much about it. On rarer occasions, this can also happen to inorganic matter. Every boulder could very well be an ancient artificial intelligence, cursed to be only occupied by its own mind in a void without perception or senses. 

* Ruins - The Edge is littered with a variety of derelict industrial buildings - expect to find aqueducts, reservoirs, factories, reactors and processing plants. These were not built by anyone - in fact, they are the product of a single pebble, which, throughout the years, accumulated matter in an increasingly complex shape! Inside the guts of these buildings, pipes connect to concrete walls, boilers are built upside down and silos have holes in them. The Edge's influence may be impressive in scale, but certainly not in the engineering department.

* End of the World - It is said that when all will be consumed by the ever-growing flesh, rock and metal, the Edge's properties will reverse, eroding itself until it returns to the barren state it once was at the very beginning. It would have been interesting to ask the savant who came up with this theory what would happen afterwards, but sadly, they became a mass of unthinking insects after an unfortunate accident.

* Rebirth - When a thinking individual disappears in the Edge, often through conversion or excessive aging, they tend to eventually come back in some way, for the Edge does not favor permanent destruction. Many sometimes wonder how many times they've been reborn. Nightmares of being turned into or eaten by terrifying creatures sometimes haunt one's nights. One may hope these aren't visions of their past lives - what terrible moments these must have been!
