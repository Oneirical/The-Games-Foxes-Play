Current project: circle UI

Make the souls in a circle with squares for empty slots. below there are buttons for legendary tree & modulator tree, maybe some rose thing too
A real text log at the bottom like most roguelikes?
You can place Rose/Serene in a slot to make it glamorous/harmonized
after a forceful removal all souls that go in there afterwards receive an upgrade
add a screenshake if removal fails




- Dreamy rooms that can be backtracked but do not actually fit in a grid.

The reason the game is in glyphs is because it must be "censored" as some creatures are cognitohazardous.

A weird item that induces a positive effect if your room path causes two rooms to superpose upon each other - maybe a shizapis passive?

Cool item that lets you place a legendary in a slot it's not supposed to go in

An item that occasionally gives difficult "Simon Says" rules to follow. The player is rewarded for not transgressing.

A massive enemy over 9 tiles, composed of combined textures. Maybe in the Spire.

A Soul that freezes time in an area, and damages everything not frozen.

Items that lets you use Glamorous or Harmonized versions of their souls outside their normal branches.

Keep the invtree texture, use it as a cool legendary soul effect that has something to do with the inventory.

For next devlog:

*"A glass canister filled with wispy, pink vapour. The label reads, 'Once the fluorescent tubes' buzzing becomes unbearable, break immediately and inhale contents. May induce ego death.'"*

- Saints' Breath description

The dungeon branch that is currently known as the "Roseic Circus" will be *merged* with Faith's End, and will be made accessible only through the inhalation of the mysterious psychedelic toxin already used by some of the game's enemies - Saints' Breath. This should encourage the player to clear a few rooms, toke some of "that sweet pink stuff", and then *retrace their steps* as they now have a new series of hallucinatory creatures to fend off in these normally deserted rooms, with appropriate psychic-themed loot.

I'm really excited about this plan and the progress done this week, and I look forward to deepening this concept!
