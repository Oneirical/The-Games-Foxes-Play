Current project:

- Dreamy rooms that can be backtracked but do not actually fit in a grid.

The reason the game is in glyphs is because it must be "censored" as some creatures are cognitohazardous.

An item that occasionally gives difficult "Simon Says" rules to follow. The player is rewarded for not transgressing.

A massive enemy over 9 tiles, composed of combined textures. Maybe in the Spire.

A Soul that freezes time in an area, and damages everything not frozen.

Items that lets you use Glamorous or Harmonized versions of their souls outside their normal branches.
