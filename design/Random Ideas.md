## This is a chaotic canvas on which I launch all the random things I come up with while going about my day. It is not meant to be comprehensible.

**Current Project**
* Release 0.2.

* Make all Souls actually work.
* Make it so Sugcha comments after becoming tired.
* Add tile abilties. Like "opens on room clear". Maybe make returnExits different too.
* Fix mouse movement with falling and para. If there's a bug there.
* Make mouse movement follow Terminal.
* Review dialogue and Negentropy nerdiness being too weird.

**UI**

* Add a rose button in the bottom right. Actually, maybe it should be a status effect tracker instead...
* Make it so souls in the wheel don't disappear when leaving room to reward good play
* A real text log at the bottom like most roguelikes? with a confirm prompt if you draw after 0 resolve
* numeric system based on basic castes.

**Rooms & Creatures**

* lotus incense. sacrifice a legendary to mark the room with a respawn/recall point.
* a gardener room that is completely peaceful but gets ridiculously hectic if the player dares step on a flower.
* A peaceful lake that becomes sinister while using roseic toxin.
* A massive enemy over 9 tiles, composed of combined textures. Maybe in the Spire.

**Lore**

* Rename Ipseity to Complexity/Value.
* Harmonizers are invincible and ethereal outside the spire, because they can only harm their own. In the Spire you have a bit more power over them, as the influence of the environment makes you a little bit more like them.
* Make it clearer why enemies attack the player - they are desperate for a ride and are also testing to see if Terminal is their true saviour. Maybe add dialogue upon entering random rooms that highlights this
* The reason the game is in glyphs is because it must be "censored" as some creatures are cognitohazardous. The Harmonizers/Roseic Servants in particular.
* Zaint's philosophy is apathy and detatchment. This makes sense, because altruism has no place in a world where literally everyone is a god with unlimited resources.
* Also his name is just zaint because he started with a Z, but never finished out of laziness and just kept calling himself "saint" after his noble title.
* He should be placed in the title screen and talk to new players. And also go blehh a lot. While the player is slightly translucent.

**Souls**

* Psychodrones risk being grindy if they let you farm Ordered souls. Find a way to avoid this.
* A passive Soul that does something cool when the deck is reshuffled. Maybe something to do with Serenes to make them less of a chore... Good synergy with purpizug.
* A soul that places a recall point when equipped, and teleports you back there when unequipped.
* A weird soul that induces a positive effect if your room path causes two rooms to superpose upon each other - maybe a shizapis passive?
* Non-serenes with effects on modulators.
* Cool soul that lets you place a legendary in a slot it's not supposed to go in
* A soul that occasionally gives difficult "Simon Says" rules to follow. The player is rewarded for not transgressing.
* A Soul that freezes time in an area, and damages everything not frozen.
* Something that lets you use Glamorous or Harmonized versions of their souls outside their normal branches. - this might be managing to pull out a serene or a roseic out of the slot it's stuck to, leaving it influenced.
* Keep the invtree texture, use it as a cool legendary soul effect that has something to do with the inventory.
* probably terrible. cast empty soul slots on the wheel to lose them forever with a deranged legendary.

**Weird/overly ambitious stuff**

* The final boss being inspired by M. Industries. Inside Ronin's spaceship (built out of negentropic force), farm tokens on 4 plates while being assailed by the Harmony, and buy upgrades in the form of pushable boxes to give more firepower to Ronin's squad.

* Ronin's weapon should be a big-ass war vacuum.

* Also look into a possible internet component to this encounter.

* If a trailer is ever made it should not be a trailer, but rather pure boss battle footage with Zaint who criticizes the concept of trailers. After all, if an image is worth a thousand words, surely a video must be worth a million.

* Bringing Sugcha all the way to the end of the game should result in something funny.

**To use later**

*"A glass canister filled with wispy, pink vapour. The label reads, 'Once the fluorescent tubes' buzzing becomes unbearable, break immediately and inhale contents. May induce ego death.'"*

- Saints' Breath description

The dungeon branch that is currently known as the "Roseic Circus" will be *merged* with Faith's End, and will be made accessible only through the inhalation of the mysterious psychedelic toxin already used by some of the game's enemies - Saints' Breath. This should encourage the player to clear a few rooms, toke some of "that sweet pink stuff", and then *retrace their steps* as they now have a new series of hallucinatory creatures to fend off in these normally deserted rooms, with appropriate psychic-themed loot.

I'm really excited about this plan and the progress done this week, and I look forward to deepening this concept!

**NOTE: If a wanderer of the Internet stumbles upon this log, the features mentioned in it are not finished yet (I am working on them this week) and the text below may change. The reason I write these in advance is because pretending that I made great progress inspires me to actually make great progress. Fake it til' you make it. Everything I post in Sharing Saturday - that means, all previous devlog entries in this folder - are completed, of course.**
