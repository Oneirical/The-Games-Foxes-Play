## This is a chaotic canvas on which I launch all the random things I come up with while going about my day. It is not meant to be comprehensible.

**UI**

* Add a rose button in the bottom right. Actually, maybe it should be a status effect tracker instead...
* Make it so souls in the wheel don't disappear when leaving room to reward good play
* A real text log at the bottom like most roguelikes? with a confirm prompt if you draw after 0 resolve
* numeric system based on basic castes.

**Rooms & Creatures**

* lotus incense. sacrifice a legendary to mark the room with a respawn/recall point.
* a gardener room that is completely peaceful but gets ridiculously hectic if the player dares step on a flower.
* A peaceful lake that becomes sinister while using roseic toxin.
* A massive enemy over 9 tiles, composed of combined textures. Maybe in the Spire.

**Lore**

* Rename Ipseity to Complexity/Value.
* Harmonizers are invincible and ethereal outside the spire, because they can only harm their own. In the Spire you have a bit more power over them, as the influence of the environment makes you a little bit more like them.
* Make it clearer why enemies attack the player - they are desperate for a ride and are also testing to see if Terminal is their true saviour. Maybe add dialogue upon entering random rooms that highlights this
* The reason the game is in glyphs is because it must be "censored" as some creatures are cognitohazardous. The Harmonizers/Roseic Servants in particular.
* Zaint's philosophy is apathy and detatchment. This makes sense, because altruism has no place in a world where literally everyone is a god with unlimited resources.
* Also his name is just zaint because he started with a Z, but never finished out of laziness and just kept calling himself "saint" after his noble title.
* He should be placed in the title screen and talk to new players. And also go blehh a lot. While the player is slightly translucent.

**Souls**

* Terminal's creator as a starter Soul. Made to be thrown away at the first opportunity. 

* A soul that places a recall point when equipped, and teleports you back there when unequipped.
* A weird soul that induces a positive effect if your room path causes two rooms to superpose upon each other - maybe a shizapis passive?
* Cool soul that lets you place a legendary in a slot it's not supposed to go in
* A soul that occasionally gives difficult "Simon Says" rules to follow. The player is rewarded for not transgressing.
* A Soul that freezes time in an area, and damages everything not frozen.
* Something that lets you use Glamorous or Harmonized versions of their souls outside their normal branches. - this might be managing to pull out a serene or a roseic out of the slot it's stuck to, leaving it influenced.
* Keep the invtree texture, use it as a cool legendary soul effect that has something to do with the inventory.
* probably terrible. cast empty soul slots on the wheel to lose them forever with a deranged legendary.

**Weird/overly ambitious stuff**

* The final boss being inspired by M. Industries. Inside Ronin's spaceship (built out of negentropic force), farm tokens on 4 plates while being assailed by the Harmony, and buy upgrades in the form of pushable boxes to give more firepower to Ronin's squad.

* Ronin's weapon should be a big-ass war vacuum.

* Also look into a possible internet component to this encounter.

* If a trailer is ever made it should not be a trailer, but rather pure boss battle footage with Zaint who criticizes the concept of trailers. After all, if an image is worth a thousand words, surely a video must be worth a million.

* Bringing Sugcha all the way to the end of the game should result in something funny.

**To use later**

*"A glass canister filled with wispy, pink vapour. The label reads, 'Once the fluorescent tubes' buzzing becomes unbearable, break immediately and inhale contents. May induce ego death.'"*

- Saints' Breath description

The dungeon branch that is currently known as the "Roseic Circus" will be *merged* with Faith's End, and will be made accessible only through the inhalation of the mysterious psychedelic toxin already used by some of the game's enemies - Saints' Breath. This should encourage the player to clear a few rooms, toke some of "that sweet pink stuff", and then *retrace their steps* as they now have a new series of hallucinatory creatures to fend off in these normally deserted rooms, with appropriate psychic-themed loot.

I'm really excited about this plan and the progress done this week, and I look forward to deepening this concept!
