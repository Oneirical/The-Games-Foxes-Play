## This is a chaotic canvas on which I launch all the random things I come up with while going about my day and bugs I notice throughout playtesting. It is not meant to be comprehensible.

* Epsilon momentum + reverse direction + teleport entity? make it possible for the player to control without edits

**Performance Optimizations**

* astar
* twinningAssimilation & cloneSoul

**Animation**

* Review the tiles display, it is making it impossible to play knockback animations on far knockback effects
* Add a queue to the offset to knockback THEN move

**Save and Load**.

Just the souls and tags are left

**Names for stuff**

Righteousness, Ever-Upwards
Left-Pawed Paths, Sinking Down

### Places
Crimson Forest
Jade Vaults
World Seed
Last Saint's Gardens
Serene Spire
Roseic Circus

### Objectives
Regal Frills and Golden Yellows
Purple Taint Chokes Out Life
Flaring Orange Burns Away Restraint
One World, All Black and White
Sickly Sweet Ribbons of Pink
Bright Red Blood, A Shriek
Surging Cyan Rivers Drown Out Thought

### Characters
Epsilon
Senet
Ataixa
Rose
Anisychia
Boolean

**Soul/axioms ideas**

* A recall point/teleport across layers.
* A soul that occasionally gives difficult "Simon Says" rules to follow. The player is rewarded for not transgressing.
* orbital laser form, hits 50 % whole screen in stripes
* NOT: inverts all targets, what was now isn't and what wasn't now is
* A Soul which enlarges/reduces the player, using synchronised walking Cages for the latter

**Mechanics**

turn infinite loops in souls (2x2 axioms) into the harmony mechanic, they may convert entire floors in a chain reaction and make it look like the Serene Spire

hypnowells swap creatures by bringing them to nowhere dimension, maybe the only way to access it is to break that swap effect?

Cages for the vile, to use as currency

**UI**

* Inspect elements in the sidebar to know what they do.
* A better ui for descriptions, with definitions for each keyword like 'exhale' or 'targets' or the status effects, StS style
* Add Form grid (range targeters) images in their descriptions for clarity
* Use a viewport to change the screen resolution?

**Lore and flavour**

* Serene Souls should change their names into increasingly positive titles as the harmony progresses.
* A joke room where a Harmonizer insists on the purity and the Sameness of the roguelike genre. Mention that all roguelikes are theoretically real-time due to the player having a limited mortal lifespan, which the Harmony is exempt from. Only the Harmony can play true roguelikes.
* The reason the game is in glyphs is because it must be "censored" as some creatures are cognitohazardous. The Harmony in particular.
* “It is not death we distribute, it is uplifting. All ruffians of this world contain a primordial Fluffy - all we do is permutation of the switches in incorrect positions, while leaving the correct ones in place. Some are more Fluffy than others before our intervention […]” Therefore, the more (narcisstic) you are, the more vulnerable you become.

* Terminal is caged because he needs to be the observer of the whole world for it to continue ticking.
* Death messages for what happens when your soul is immobilized after the death of your body - only one Plane is left to tick. How does the population react?
* Fluffy is an empty shell, if defeated she may be replaced and duplicate you.

* Rose's ability to "drown out in endless lives".
* Give Rose something about choked souls, drowned souls, the player's own soul still existing but with piles upon piles of roseic souls on top preventing access to who they once were

* A room that makes you forgo ever getting achievements to cleanse your mind of external motivation.
* a joke metaprogression shop that does something ridiculously insignificant, like +1/1 million chance of a certain room appearing or changing the colour of something in the GUI.

**Creatures**

You should be able to control Epsilon without extra weird stuff.
Give Epsilon a giga tongue or some cool shockwave.

* A massive enemy over 9 tiles, composed of combined textures. Maybe in the Spire. Alpha, Ordered champion?

**Areas**

### Last Saint's Gardens
* Pressurized tanks of glamorous pollen, which spreads rapidly if broken in the Gardens.
* a gardener room that is completely peaceful but gets ridiculously hectic if the player dares step on a flower.
* A peaceful lake that becomes sinister once pollen is inhaled.
* Rose, at the very end, can warp the player all over the game if provoked.

### Crimson Forest
* Anisychia's anguish causes constant reality distortions into different phobia-themed areas
* And make it print out tons of red and bold text very fast panic zealot style.
* A grim snowy area where ominous creatures patrol. Having 1 on screen is okay. 2 is a death sentence and makes them rush towards the player.

### Industrial Apex
* A giant library giga room with all the text strings of the game.
* Puzzles. Boolean loves puzzles! Don't overdo them.
* A pole that pulls in creatures and sucks out their souls.
* A relentless but slow intangible pursuer that sucks out souls.

### Faith's End
* Ataixa craves corruption. These rooms can only be accessed by drawing from the deck of the Unhinged and wiping out realities.
* A radiation protection facility. Offers linking with creatures to absorb Axiom-based distortions.
* It leads into a wasteland with tons of extremely dangerous threats that warp your Souls randomly, potentially causing Harmonic outbreaks and softlocks.

### Jade Vaults
* Conveyor belts and water currents to push the Felidol toys/statues around.
* An escherian staircase with Felidols floating around the water, gaining wealth for the Vile
* Ridiculous incremental mechanics which the player is expected to cheat at.
* Pocket dimensions and statue soul uplinks for sale.
* A Felidol staring and grinning room. Creepy.
* The ultimate room of this place should be a "monster industry", assaulting Senet from the other side of a disconnected area.

### Random
* A rooftop level with walking on walls.
* A purist armadillo who only respects the player if they have abstained from chaotic acts, zin style.
* An empty void with a cockroach playing an instrument. Possibly linked to detatched pads.
* An observatory populated by the glace-crowns. They watch the Harmonic Origin from afar. Slightly corrupted by harmony, they don't like intruders who don't look like them.
* A challenge with falling boxes with MoveDownBot

**Bugs**

* Bug if something turns tangible on top of something already tangible?

**wtf zone**

* Simple pvp duels with components loadouts?
* After all, if an image is worth a thousand words, surely a video must be worth a million. Maybe put regular game footage in generic trailer format, with the Harmony subtly replacing elements here and there, or even pausing the music and showing off one of their rooms before the video switches to something else like nothing happened. Have them take over the footage progressively.
